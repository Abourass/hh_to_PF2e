## Harcovi's Notebook

might help me see something new, I hope so.

### Night, six days past —
#### Body discovered in a hovel on Blood Boil in the Lower Ward.

##### Facts are as follows:

* Victim was a human male, about 80 years old, found wearing a sleeping robe decorated with the sun-blade icon of the Believers of the Source.
* Victim had a look of horror locked on his face, his eyes wide, his mouth twisted in fear.
* One massive cut across the victim's abdomen produced much blood and was the apparent cause of death. The flesh was sliced open with a large, sharp blade of some sort, possibly a long sword.
* Two messages were found at the scene. The first was a hand-written note on a sheet of fine parchment. It read: "Chaos is the only law, washed clean in the blood of order." The second appeared scrawled across the wall in the victim's blood. The handwriting was identical to that on the note. It read: "Now it begins."
* Victim identified as Favur of the Believers of the Source, and a follower of the tenets of law. The hovel belongs to his faction.
* Victim was found by the victim's housekeeper, a female gnome named Eltiva, who lives two doors down.

### Night, five days past —
#### Body discovered in an Athar bunkhouse on Powers Row, near the Shattered Temple. Facts known:

##### Facts are as follows:

* Victim was a bariuar female, about 24 years old, identified as Vienna of the Athar.
* The following clues have led me to link this murder with the one committed last night. Victim wore a terrified expression, was killed by two cuts from a large, sharp blade, and a note written on fine parchment matches the previous note exactly. There was no blood-written message this time. Those who knew her tell me she was "of the law."
* In addition to the victim, two other faction members were present in the bunkhouse last night — Defiant Munrot and Kuarn the Ancient. Kuarn found the victim and called for assistance. Munrot issued a statement, but the stink of bub around him makes his material worthless.

### Night, four days past —
#### A third body fitting the pattern of what I've come to call "the Law-killer Murders" was found in a drinking hall named The Ascension, located near the Great Foundry. The facts:

* Victim was a female halfling named Lini, a lawful neutral member of the Believers of the Source. She was killed by three slashes from a blade, had a look of fear etched on her face, and had a parchment note pinned to her tunic that read "Chaos is the only law, washed clean in the blood of order."
* The overturned tables lead me to believe that the victim was chased around the room before being killed. She also had a strange burn mark on her arm, possibly the result of some kind of magical discharge.

### Night, three days past —
#### The fourth victim this heinous criminal was discovered in a library in the City's Court. The facts:

* Victim was a human male, identified as Fassa of the Fraternity of Order. The same pattern emerged — the look of terror, the cuts from a large blade (four this time), the parchment note with the same chant scrawled across the floor in the victim's blood.
* One other thing: I found traces of a white powder around the floor of the room. I took a sample and gave it to our alchemists to analyze. It showed up clearly on the black margle floor of the library, wonder if it was present at the other crime scenes?

### Night, two days past —
#### The Lawkiller has just made this situation extremely personal. I write with tears in my eyes. 

* The latest victim was Tenskor, a member of my team of Harmonium investigators. He was obviously killed as a warning to the rest of the faction. He was slashed five times, starting with a shallow cut across his forhead and ending with a deep slash across his gut. Terror twisted his features, and the note pinned to his chest had an extra line added to the familiar chant: "There is no safety in order; because chaos is everywhere."
* Tenskor was found on Harmonium Street in front of the City Barracks. He was staked to an X-shaped cross so that we'd all see him when we awoke. I found a small iron rod that was blackened as though a great amount of energy had passed through it. No other evidence was discovered, and none of the locals admit to hearing or seeing anything.

### Night, one day past —
#### The latest victim was found at The Parted Veil, a book shop on Forgotten Lane, by the store's owner. The details:

* Victim was a githzerai male named Keluk the Gray. The scene played out like all the others: expression of terror, multiple wounds made by a large blade (six wounds this time), a parchment note with the familiar chant was pinned to his shredded tunic. He was sprawled across a reading table, his blood staining a stack of books — texts on the tenets of law and order.
* The shop owner, Kesto Brighteyes, discovered the body when he arrived to open the store. He provided details on what he saw and assured me he didn't touch anything.

For all these clues, I'm no closer to solving these murders. I pray this new evidence might help me see something new, I hope so.
