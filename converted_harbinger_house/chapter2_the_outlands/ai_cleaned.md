This part of the adventure takes the PCs to the
Outlands in search of Sougad, the barmy who

wants to become a power of chaos and murder.

They might also be searching for Trolan and Those Who Court the Lady,

followers. The PCs find that Trolan is leading a massive pilgrimage across
the Outlands on its way to the Cage. A friendly cleric (actually Pastor
Browen, Nari’s servant) tells the PCs that if they hurry, they can catch up

with Trolan in the gate-town of Curst.

In Curst, Trolan and his followers have become trapped within the ra-
zorvine-covered walls. The same thing happens to the PCs once they enter
the burg, so they must find a way to escape the town. But first they have to

deal with Pastor Browen, the Wall Watch, and members of
RS Loz the Revolutionary League. Time is against them, though; the
a majority of Trolan’s followers bypassed Curst and are al-
ready on their way to Sigil. If the PCs don’t escape in time,

the cultists face the same fate as the group in Bloodgem Park.

AF+ERMAFtH IN tHE PARK

The bodies of the 20 cultists lie cut and bleeding in Bloodgem Park. The
spectacular tragedy has drawn the usual crowd of curiosity-seekers, as well
as dabus and Dustmen intent on cleaning up the mess. Narcovi and her Har-
monium agents arrive fairly quickly, trying to restore order and sort things
out before the dabus clear away the evidence. If it wasn't obvious that the
deaths were the work of the Lady of Pain, Narcovi might try to pin them on
the PCs, as they happen to be in the thick of things once again. Instead, she
asks the PCs about Sougad and the events in the park, then moves on to ex-
amine the bodies.

<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-03 -->

The dabus begin to clean
away the blood and make the park pre-
sentable, but the actual removal of the bodies is
left to the Dustmen. The Dead wait until Narcovi has
examined the site before preparing the bodies for
transport to the Mortuary (though what they want the
victim's bodies for is left to inventive DMs and other
PLANESCAPE adventures).

FACt+@L AMBAR’S OFFER

After a brief amount of time passes, Facto] Ambar approaches the PCs with guards in
tow. He arrived on the scene right after Narcovi, once he was certain the area was
secure. If the PCs have never met him, Ambar introduces himself and gets right to
the dark of his visit. Read:

factol Ambar explains that the Godsmen maintain a shelter for these powers-to-be. He asks the
PCs to recover the missing barmies before any more lives are lost, offering both jink and the grati-
tude of his faction. If the PCs agree, Ambar hands them the files on Trolan and Sougad (see “factol
Ambar's Files” on page 34, which should be photocopied and given to the players). He notes that all
of the dead cultists came from Ecstasy, a gate-town on the Outlands — the best place to begin a
search for Trolan. Ambar also asks about the portal Sougad used to escape. If the PCs point it out,
Ambar sends one of his guards (a wizard) to check it out with a warp sense spell. A few moments
later, the guard returns with the relevant information: The gate leads to Ecstasy, it requires a leaf
from a star petal flower to activate, and it was indeed used in the recent past.

If the PCs refuse Ambar’s offer, there are other ways to get them to Ecstasy. Narcovi could ask
them to go on behalf of the Harmonium, as Sougad remains a threat that must be stopped. Kariana
(sce below) could convince them to rescue her brother from the cult’s influence. Finally, if nothing
clse presents itself and the PCs refuse to leave Sigil, they could be tricked into heading to Ecstasy.
factol Ambar and Narcovi both have the means for planting a gate key on one of the PCs. In this
case, at some point the PCs will step through an archway or door that’s a portal to the gate-town and
be transported to the location of Sougad’s latest activities.

‘Course, if the PCs don’t accept Ambar's offer, they're not going to get his files on Trolan and
Sougad (unless the DM wishes to allow them another means of obtaining the files).

KARIANA’S PLEA

A young woman in the crowd shows more than morbid
curiosity in the events that transpired in Bloodgem Park:
Kariana of Ecstasy (Pri 2 human/0/Fratemity of Order/LG),
whose two brothers were inspired by Trolan’s haunting
words about the Lady and joined his cult. The older
brother, Benjim. was among those who died when the La-
dy’s shadow passed over the park. The younger boy, Kedd,
parely 16, is still at Trolan’s side.

Kariana wears 4 simple blue robe with its hood pulled
up over her satin-black hair. She watches the clean-up
from the edges of the crowd, listening tO comments that
ripple from one end of the park to the other. It doesn't take
long for word to get around that the law-killer was ch
out of Sigil and that the cutters responsible are the ones
speaking to Facto! Ambar.

Kariana waits until the PCs have finished talking t0
the factol before she approaches them. It doesn't matter
what the outcome of their mecting with Ambar is; the PCs
may still agree to help Kariana. Read:

A figure in a blue, hooded robe walks toward you.
While the figure’s features are hidden, the shape beneath
the robe is obviously female. She stops only 4 foot or two
away from you, and you can see her large. dark cyes, pale

skin, and wisps of black hair straying from the safety of

her hood.

“The chant’s toud about you, cutters,” she says in a
sorrow-filled yoice. “Did you really chase off the law-
killer?”

If the PCs answer truthfully, Kariana points toward
the body of a dark-haired man, his handsome face slashed
open as if by a sharp razor. As a pair of Dustmen drape 3
sheet over the dead sod and prepare to lift him onto the
waiting wagon. the woman chokes back tears- Read:

“That's Benjim. My brother. He was a happy. conrent
body back in Ecstasy. Then he heard Trolan’s words, and
they fed him fe his death.” She pauses. watching her
brother's corpse disappear into the back of the Dustmen’s
wagon. “My younger brother, Kedd. js still out there, letting
Trolan fill his head with images of love. But there's no love
for them here — just death. | need help. Will you help me?”

If the PCs are interested, Kariana explains that her
in Ecstasy’s Philosopher's
Court, and both seemed different after the experience. “His
words seeped into their souls. Both Benjim and Kedd fell in
love with the Lady,” she tells them. “Please — find Kedd be-
fore he makes pilgrimage to the Cage- ll pay you with
everything f own.” She holds out 2 small leather pouch
containing 37 gold pieces. 62 silver pieces, and 45 copper
pieces. It's the sum of her wealth, but she offers it all to the

PCs if they agree to save her Jittle brother.

435%

During all of this, Nari the succubus watches from the
safety of the curious crowd, eager to see how much may-
hem the events she’s set in motion have caused. When she
learns that Sougad has been chased off, her anger flares. It
doesn’t take her too long to find the cutters responsible for
ruining this part of her plan.

Nari spends the rest of this scene observing the PCs
and learning all she can about them. She doesn't interact
with them at this time, but she does begin planning how to
gain her revenge. The DM should assume that Nari can
hear everything the PCs discuss in Bloodgem Park. This al-
lows her to send Pastor Browen, a barmy from Harbinger
House, to stop the PCs on the Outlands,

During the time that Nari observes them, the DM
should give each PC one chance to spot her by making 4
Wisdom check at -4 (though not all at the same time). Any
time a PC fails a check, he still sees something interesting:
q strange OF intriguing person in the crowd, factol Ambar
talking to Narcovi, Narcovi finding some possible clue in
the blood-splattered grass Kariana watching them, and so
on. If any PC makes the check, he spots Nari — the most
beautiful young woman the PC has ever seen. As soon as
she notices that she’s been spotted, Nari disappears into
the crowd; the PCs cant catch her at this time.

DM Note: If a PC spots Nari in the crowd, sh
use her charm ability on that PC (by winking oF smiling).
Secretly make the character's saving throw; failure indi-
cates that the PC is charmed. However, charmed PCs
should not be told that they're under Nari's spell. Fact is,
they won't feel any differently at all at this point in the ad-
venture.

Even if she succeeds in charming one oF more PCs,
Nari’s not planning on “using” them for anything just yet.
She simply wants to have as many people on her side as

possible, in case she needs the help later.

slows down even more, stretching stories or directions into

@ |r THe PCs Ask Asout Sougan: If the PCs arrived in
Ecstasy through the same gate as Sougad, Artemor met the
barmy murderer a few hours back. He remembers the wild
hair, the fiery eyes, and the menacing long sword. He also
remembers that Sougad wasn't particularly friendly; in
fact. he was downright rude.

If the PCs used a different gate, Artemor never saw
Sougad. However, he admits that a poor sod who was just
passing through got put into the dead-book a few hours
ago. “/ heard that a cleric of Moradin was found all cur up
over at The Impulsive dabus,” Artemor says. “Such a ter-
rible thing to happen, even if it was a stuffy old dwarf.”

* if mi PCs Ask Apout Troan: Artemor hasn't been
in Ecstasy for more than a few years, so he knows little
about the bard who grew up among the plinths. He does
know about Those Who Court the Lady, as they recruited
some of the locals a few days back. If the PCs are patient
enough to wait, Artemor eventually directs them to the
new temple dedicated to Trolan, beloved of the Lady of
Pain. “! haven't been there myself, you understand, but
what started as just another expression of personal growth
has become rather. . . restricting, if you catch my meaning.

here. The bariaur’s sample dialogue follows; however, the
DM shouldn't simply read the entire dialogue aloud. In-
stead, break it up according to how the PCs approach and
question Chereng.

“f knew Trolan.” Chereng remembers. “We grew up to-
gether, to met him when we were both children. Trolan had
just arrived, walking into the city on the road from the
Outlands. He was only eight, but he apparently made his
way here on lis own, He never talked about it, but f knew
he had been abandoned. We became fast friends, and his
dreams and songs and siories were better than any words
of wisdom spoken in the temples or shouted from the tops
of the plinths. When | wanted to do something that was a
little wicked or impinged on someone's personal space,
Trolan would talk me out of tt. Too bad | couldn't return
the favor. He was a good soul, and I miss him a lot.”

3. MIRESSA’S TOWNHOUSE

Miressa (P1/2 human/0/—/NG), daughter of Kagorius, the
Philosopher King, spends most of her time in the King’s
townhouse. The King set up this refuge as a place to get
away from the rigors of the Philosopher's Court, but he
rarely makes use of it himself.

As with Chereng’s sample dialogue, the DM should
parcel out the following information in normal conversa-
tion — not just read it from beginning to end.

“Yes, J knew him. We were friends, then lovers. How |
loved that voung man! He had a voice like a summer's
breeze and a smile that was brighter than the sun. Even my
father liked him, for his bardic talents made him one of the
best speakers at my father's debates. Not that Trolan spoke
out often — at least, not before he heard about the Lady.

“A cleric visited the city that year, on his way from
Sigil to Elysium. He told stories about the City of Doors,
and Trolan became fascinated with the images and chant of
the place. When the cleric told him about the Lady of Pain,
Trolan’s eyes lit up with a fire that 1 could never ignite. He
fell in love with Sigil’s icon, composing songs and ballads
to her while he was with me. Before the year ended, | knew
that | had lost him. He said he was sorry, He said good-
bye. Then he was gone, and my heart went with him. I tried
to see him when he returned a few days ago, but he was
still singing the Lady's praises, By the currents of Oceanus,
how I hate her!”

If the PCs ask Miressa where Trolan went, she doesn’t
know, but suggests they check at the temple recently built
in his name (Area 5). She also mentions The Impulsive
dabus (Area 4), a tavern where Trolan used to spend much
of his time.

4. THE IMPULSIVE dabus

This inn and tavern in the Temple District is run by a tiefling

named Ogan (PI/d tiefling/0/Fated/CN). Ogan's owned the

place for years, and he gave a young Trolan his first job as a

bard a long time ago. No matter what time of day the PCs

visit The Impulsive dabus, they find the place crowded, but

friendly and very inviting. The recent murders in town have

cast a bit of a pall over the tavern, but for the

most part, things are still

upbeat. Ogan is among the

members of the commu-

nity calling for action, as

the murders seem directed

against visitors to Ecstasy — the

same bodies that come to his inn and spend lots of

jink.

If the PCs ask Ogan about Trolan, they might

learn the following information, revealed in bits
and pieces during a normal conversation:
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-09 -->

“He was my best attraction in those days," Oqan rem-
inisces. “Trolan's voice and lyre really packed “em in. Even
the berks who sit on top of the plinths'd climb down to lis-
ten to Trolan sing and play. ‘Course, they drank plenty of
ale and wine on those nights, and even the Dark Hunter
was known to come by now and then to hear Trolan per-
form. Trolan was going to make me rich, and 1 was going
to let him. Then that stupid cleric showed up and ruined
everything!

“You never tell an impressionable young sod like
Trolan about something wondrous he can't ever have. It
was a recipe for disaster! Now look what's going on. Trolan
comes back and the locals've built him a temple!
The Lady of Pain! I'm from Sigil, and
let me tell you, nor even a
barmy would [ry to wor-
ship her! You'd have to be
suicidal,

“Say, can I get you
cutters some drinks?

The star petal wine ts
particularly tasty this

time of day...”

At the inn, the OHLY WER CAN: «5
PCs meet a seemingly
friendly cleric who insists on
helping them in their quest.
However, the berk's really
Pastor Browen (Pi/ human/P12/—/CE), a

barmy from Harbinger House sent by Nari to delay the PCs
and hinder their progress. Having learned that Trolan’s
been trapped in the gate-town of Curst for a few days,
Browen approaches the PCs to pass on the news. The
barmy hopes the PCs'll go there and get stuck as well.

A man wearing spiky armor covered with odd protru-
sions walks over. carrying a full pitcher of ale. “Fill your
mugs, bloods?” the man asks. You notice he has a huge
mace slung at his belt and the symbol of the Xaosifects
pinned ro his breast.

Browen acts like an addle-coved Xaositect, but he
never reveals his darker side, mentions the Mad God he
worships, or tries to preach to the PCs at this time. Instead,
he engages them in friendly conversation, waits for an ap-
propriate opening, then iets them know what he’s heard.
“The barmy wha's been singing abour Sigil's high-up? |
heard he’s in Curst, preaching to the citizens and organiz-
ing a pilgrimage to the Cage. ” After he drops the bait, Pas-
tor Browen downs his drink and wanders out of the inn.

DM Nore: More information about Browen — in-
cluding his full game statistics - appears on page 45, near
the section where the PCs are most likely to fight the
barmy. Browen’s not going to attack the group in Ecstasy;
he plans to ambush them in Curst.

— JAK@LY. PREACHING At
TROLAN’S +€EMPLE

5. tHe TEMPLE ef +He BEL@VED ONE

After Trolan recruited a few of the locals and left Ecstasy
to preach in other towns, a young man named Jakoly (Pr/
3 human/P3/Believers of the Source/NG) found great
truth in Trolan’s words, Jakoly believes that Trolan’s more
than a prophet — he thinks the tiefling is a power. With the
help of other berks who heard Trolan speak, Jakoly reno-
vated an abandoned temple and set up a new religion in
the City of Plinths.
While the new religion hasn’t caught on like wildfire,
it has gathered a handful of devoted followers.
Among these devotees are a few lawful types
who were passing through Ecstasy when the
words of Trolan (as presented by Jakoly)
made them see the light. Since
the murders began, though, a
Jot more people have flocked
to the temple's open doors.
Jakoly’s preaching has touched those
who are frightened by recent events,
and the young man is feeding
those fears to bolster the new
religion.

“The Dark
Hunter can't help
you,” Jakoly preaches. “Neither
can the Sun Master nor the
Philosopher King. But the Beloved
will protect you. As he walks without harm at the Lady of
Pain's side, so too will you walk without fearing the blade
of the murderer that seeks to cut you.”

Some members of the temple can tell the PCs that
Trolan was going to visit other gate-towns before heading
back to Sigil. "By now he should be all the way to Curst,”
one of the devoted mentions.

S@®UGAD’S At+ACK

Sougad knows Trolan from the time they both spent in
Harbinger House. As the murderer carves a bloody path
through Ecstasy, he learns about the Temple of the Beloved
One, a place that causes great rage to flare within his soul.
“How dare they worship that charlatan!” Sougad fumes. “!
am the next power, not that fool who loves the Lady!”

After the PCs have had some time to explore Ecstasy
and learn of Sougad's activities, Lawshredder decides to
find his tenth victim among the sods gathered at Trolan’s
temple — after he sets the place on fire! The PCs might
track Sougad to the temple, or Sougad can spring into ac-
tion while the PCs are talking with Jakoly and his flock.
However it occurs, when the PCs and Sougad are both in
the temple, read:

+ 394
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-10 -->

Across the large, open hall, near the pillars that flank

he walls, the berk you've come to know as Sougad Law
shadows, shouting as he swinas

rs gathered there. “You will bou

shredder erplodes from the
his sword at the worshipe
ios and murder!” he

screams. “You will worship

The hall is 150 feet wide, and the PCs start at the op-
posite side from where Sougad appears. Thus, the barmy
gets one round to act before the PCs can retaliate. Sougad
selects his target — a lawful berk with 37 hp and AC 10 —
before leaping out of the shadows, and he hits the sod
twice during the round for 18 total points of damage.

The DM should then roll initiative for the second
round of combat. Sougad plans to continue slashing his
target until the berk dies and 10 cuts have been delivered.
As the target is a defenseless, robed cultist, Sougad
shouldn't miss often, but the DM should still roll to see if
the barmy hits (in case the target ducks, struggles, etc.).
Once the victim has been killed, Sougad can deliver all re-
maining slashes needed for the ritual in a single round.

As the second round progresses, the crowd of wor-
shipers and curiosity-seekers begins to run in panic. On
initiative 5, any PCs who haven't acted yet notice that
flames are raging around the second-floor balcony of the
temple (Sougad set the fire a few minutes before he ap-
peared). The PCs must decide whether to fight the fire, help
the crowd escape safely, battle Sougad, or perform some
combination of these actions. Read:

Fire! Flames dance along the second floor of the tem

ple, painting the entire balcony in crimson heat and thick

rowd notice the fire, too, and full

Sougad’s placed the spell components for this murder
next to a pillar, so he refuses to move too far from it. He
must kill his victim within the prescribed range of 10 feet.
If the PCs manage to save the first target, a similar berk
foolishly rushes close enough for Sougad to attack. If that
victim is saved, too, Sougad targets a lawful PC as his
prey.

Each round that the battle rages, the fire gets an ini-
tiative roll as well. On its initiative, the flames spread,
causing 1d12 points of damage to the upper floor of the
temple. After 30 points of damage, the fire spreads to the
lower floor, as flaming beams and other debris begin to
fall. After 60 points of damage (or in the round after
Sougad kills his victim), the temple becomes an inferno

and the section near Sougad collapses, apparently crush-
ing the murderer beneath stone, wood, and raging fire.

However, as soon as Sougad finishes his victim (thus
completing this step in the ritual), he gains another innate
ability: the use of a teleport without error power, once per
day. When he delivers the last slash to his victim, Sougad
draws in energy: A glowing, red aura emerges from the
victim, slides up Sougad’s sword, and enters his body. (The
PCs can see this occur.) With teleport without error,
Sougad disappears from the temple just as the balcony
falls around him. The DM should describe the scene in
such a manner as to make the group think Sougad’s been
killed.

Any PCs who were fighting Sougad at the time must
make successful Dexterity checks at -2 to leap out of the
way. Those who fail take 3d12 points of damage and are
trapped beneath the burning rubble. Each round they re-
main trapped, the characters take an additional 1d6 points
of heat and fire damage.

THe Reat Cuany: When Sougad teleported away from
the temple, he appeared near the garden gate that leads
back to Sigil (Artemor Far, sleeping off some particularly
potent ale, missed the barmy). While the PCs deal with
Trolan and Pastor Browen in Curst, Sougad is heading
back to Harbinger House, where he plans to commit the
final three murders required to make him a power.

SUPPING THE But Since Sougad’s target is an easy
mark, the barmy should be able to slay him before the
building collapses. However, if the dice show that the tem-
ple’s taken 60 points of fire damage and Sougad still hasn't
killed his tenth victim, the DM should keep the structure
standing until the victim's dead. ‘Course, it’s possible to
have parts of the building fall around the PCs — possibly
making it easier for Sougad to kill his victim — or simply

creak, groan, and threaten to
collapse at any moment.

CURS+#,
+Ht WALLED CI#FY

The PCs work their way from Ecstasy to Curst by finding a
portal or path that quickly gets them to the new gate-
town. Unlike the situation in Ecstasy, the PCs don’t have to
explore and talk to a lot of NPCs in order to get to the crux
of the scene. Instead, they find Trolan and his followers in
short order. The trick then becomes finding a way back out
of the Walled City while dealing with the trouble stirred up
by Pastor Browen.

A QUICK L®@K

Curst sits on the philosophical shores of the plane of
Carceri. For more information on the gate-town, refer to
the PLanescare Campaign Setting boxed set or A Player's
Primer to the Outlands.

+40+
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-11 -->
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-12 -->

Dusty streets and bleak architecture reveal the nature
of this burg. Most of the inhabitants of Curst are exiles

of vengeance — against those who wronged them, peeled
them, or betrayed their love or confidence, They plan great
schemes and even raise armies, but few can escape the
binds that hold Curst's residents in,

Nearly circular in shape and surrounded by a high, ra-
zorvine-covered wall, Curst is built around a gate to
Carceri. Five ring roads ripple out from the center of the
city. forming six distinct districts. Bashers called the Wall
Watch patrol the perimeter of the city. They let almost any
berk into Curst, but very few are allowed to leave. Out-
siders believe that the residents are prisoners in their own
burg, but the residents see it as a way to keep the rest of
the multiverse out. It's all a matter of perspective — one
that changes mighty quickly once a body steps through the
gate into the Walled City.

The wall and the razorvine keep folks in, of course,
but the guards of the Wall Watch do their share, too. They
require proof that a body has somewhere to g0 and a way
to get there before they'll open the gate. Beyond these
physical restrictions, two other factors —
bitterness and fear — form the chains of
this prison. Release your bitter-
ness and overcome your fear
and maybe — just maybe —
the razorvine will let you
pass.

THE R®AD
+® CURS+

Whatever mode of travel the PCs
decide to use (or the DM provides),
they wind up on a dark and dusty road
not far from Curst. A few dead bodies lie among
the thorns of the razorvine Browing beside the road,
adding to the bleakness of the terrain. Behind the bodies,
the razorvine grows so high that it blocks the view of any-
thing beyond.
As the PCs near the great outer wall of the town, one
of the dead bodies Speaks to them. Read:

Any PC who tries to examine the body must make a
successful Dexterity check with 4 -2 penalty to avoid the
thorns. A failed check indicates that the PC takes 2d3
points of damage from the razorvine. If any PC manages to
get close to the body, he finds all that remains of worth is
a belt pouch and its contents: five gold pieces, two plat-
inum pieces, and a small wooden triangle inscribed with
the icon of a metal cage (a gate key to Sigil),

ltt REAL CHAN Why did the body animate for the
PCs? Berk, things happen in the multiverse that nobody

can explain. The corpse's chant is important, how-
ever. It warns the PCs about Curst and gives them
part of the solution to foiling the trap.

ARRIVAL

The dusty approach to the Walled City is notably empty.
The stillness is broken by the sounds of the PCs’ footfalls
and the occasional cry of an unseen bird. An unadorned
wall circles the town, its exterior lacking even a hint of the
razorvine that covers the interior. The road leads to a large
Sate that opens as the PCs Set close. Read:

The gate swings open, revealing two bushers with
larac pikes waiting rw greet you, “Weleame to Curss.” one

seal the gate. If the PCs ask questions, the bash-

ers become impatient. “Are you coming in or

what?” one asks

your bone-box and make a decision.” Once in
town, the PCs notice that the inside of the

wall looks much more formidable than the out-
side. Thick razorvine crawls up the wall, making it
impossible to get closer than two feet to the actual
fortification. A wide, circular road runs along the
inside of the wall. Across it, stables, taverns, and
inns form a ring of structures leading up to the next
circular road.
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-13 -->

THE TRAP

Pastor Browen arrived in Curst shortly before the PCs

and has been hard at work ever since. The barmy told
Sergeant Qarz — one of the officers of the Wall Watch — that
a group of cutters would be arriving soon, a band who'd
caused all kinds of trouble in Sigil and some of the other
gate-towns. Browen said they're coming to Curst to stir up
the Anarchists and disturb the peace. “Besides,” he told
Qarz, “the help you provide will make my power very happy.
That means you'll get the reward you've always dreamed of.
Just make sure the cutters don’t leave for at least 24 hours.”

Sergeant Qarz agreed, convinced that the reward
would be a ticket out of Curst and back to the home he
barely remembers. With the dozen or so bashers of the
Watch loyal to him, Qarz plans to detain the PCs for at
least one full day.

Meanwhile, Pastor Browen met with a prominent
member of the local Anarchists. Xero Baox (PI/d tiefling/
F12/Revolutionary League/CE), a berk who hates authority
and loves revolution, was very receptive to Browen’s
chant. “The tiefling named Trolan has a lot of followers,”
Browen noted. “When his cutters arrive, they're going to
take over this burg and put all of us free-thinkers in the
dead-book.” That's ali it took. Now Baox is ready to smash
Trolan's cult before it gains any more momentum.

SAVING TROLAN

Once inside the town’s wall, it doesn't take the PCs long to
find Trolan. A crowd of sods dressed in silver and amber
robes mulls around a tavern marked by the sign of a skele-
tal steed with a horn protruding from its skull — The Un-
dead Unicorn. Trolan is in the tavern, depressed and anx-
ious to find a way out of Curst. Although Trolan and his
followers don't realize it, Trolan is in grave danger. Xero
Baox has a special arrow of slaying and is on his way to
use it when the PCs arrive in Curst.

As the PCs work their way toward The Undead Unicorn,
so do Baox and four Anarchist bashers. If any PCs make
successful Wisdom checks, they notice the suspicious group
entering the tavern. Baox and his gang wear ill-fitting robes
of silver and amber, their folds barely concealing the armor,
swords, bow, and quiver they're carrying. The Anarchists are
obviously not the gentle cultists they're posing as.

The PCs must hurry. They reach the door of the tavern
just before Baox nocks the arrow. On the first round of
combat, Baox puts the arrow in place on his initiative
while his bashers throw off their robes and prepare to de-
fend him. The next round, he fires the arrow unless the PCs
stop him (he’s standing about 30 feet from Trolan, on the
opposite side of the common room). If the arrow hits
Trolan, it automatically kills him, but this should only
occur if the PCs really mess up. Even if they can't stop
Baox from taking aim and firing, one of Trolan’s followers

can leap in front
of the arrow before it
hits its mark. (If the arrow hits
another target, it acts as an arrow +3.)

Baox plans to destroy Trolan no matter what. He at-
tacks the tiefling with everything he has, and he directs
similar attacks against those who stand in his way. The PCs
have to kill or otherwise incapacitate Baox to stop his fa-
natic offensive. Once Baox and his bashers are defeated,
the PCs can talk to Trolan.

DM Nove: Baox won't betray Pastor Browen, no mat-
ter what methods the PCs use to question the Anarchist.
However, Baox does parrot the reasoning Browen “helped”
him arrive at — that Trolan’s cult must be stopped before it
spells doom for free-thinking bodies everywhere.

IF TR®LAN DIES

In Chapter Il, Trolan takes part in the exploration of Har-
binger House and tries to bring the Lady of Pain into the
final battle. However, his role is not critical; if the PCs fail
to stop Xero Baox, the DM shouldn't feel absolutely com-
pelled to figure out a way to keep Trolan alive.

‘Course, Trolan’s absence in Chapter III will have a
few ramifications. The PCs'll be denied the tips he can pro-
vide on the barmies of the House, as well as the chance to
receive his healing touch. In addition, they'll lose the ex-
perience points they would have gained from saving his
life. Finally, without Trolan, the PCs'll have a much harder
time convincing Kedd and the rest of the cultists to aban-
don their deadly plan to honor the Lady of Pain.

<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-14 -->

If TR@OLAN SURVIVES

At some point, the PCs stand face-to-face with Trolan the
Beloved. When this occurs, read:

The man before you stands
Just a bit over five feet tall, with
a thin form and obvious
grace. His face
shines with the
glow of the plane-
touched. Tapered ears,
eyes of pure blue with a red-
rimmed radiance, and the
slightest growth of horns on his
high forehead mark him for what
he ts — a tiefling, a child of the planes. Long reddish-blond
hair frames his handsome face, and his beautiful smile
draws both men and women to his side. He wears the same
amber and silver robes as his followers. When he looks at
you, you feel as though you would do almost anything he
asked,
“Have you come to hear my songs, good friends?” he
asks. “Shall [tell you about the Lady, or have you come to
Join us on our pilgrimage to the heart of the Cage?”

Trolan radiates trust and friendship. No one within 10
feet of the tiefling can harm him unless they first make a
successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty to
shrug off the effects of the field of fellowship that sur-
rounds him. Trolan doesn't even have to use his innate
abilities to influence a crowd. His natural presence and
charisma, as well as his bardic talents, make him almost ir-
resistible.

He starts to tell the PCs all about the Lady of Pain and
why she deserves their love and devotion unless they steer
the conversation in another direction. They won't be able
to talk him out of his infatuation, and he never gets angry,
so arguing is pointless. If they approach him as a friend,
the PCs can convince Trolan to accompany them to Sigil —
that’s where he plans to go, anyway.

During this meeting, the PCs learn that a large group
of cultists is already on its way to Sigil. “My friend Kedd
leads them,” Trolan explains. “f wanted to speak to the cit-
izens of this town before returning to Sigil myself. Kedd
knows a route through the Court of Light that should get
them there in another two days. | have to be back by then,
too. That’s what the Lady told me. If only the Wall Watch
would let us leave!”

Ifa PC asks why Trolan has involved so many people
in his infatuation with the Lady of Pain, the tiefling pro-
vides an answer:

“After vears of hoping and wishing, the Lady finally
came to me,” Trolan explains. “She appeared to me at Har-
binger House, and she spoke the words | longed to hear.

$444

She said she loved me, but 1 had to prove my love to her. To
do this, she said I had to tell others how I felt and send
them to Sigil to share my love with the Lady. I can still
hear her beautiful voice in my head.”

THe Real CHant: As far as anyone knows, the Lady of
Pain has never spoken. It was Nari, disguised as the Lady,
who appeared before Trolan at Harbinger House. However,
if the PCs try to convince Trolan that the being that spoke
to him — whatever it was — was nof the real Lady, the tief-
ling simply smiles, shakes his head, and states that soon
the PCs, too, will believe.

DM Nore: In two days’ time, Kedd and the cultists —
with or without Trolan — will arrive at Bloodgem Park in
Sigil and conduct their ceremony to the Lady of Pain. The
PCs have that long to get out of Curst, retum to the Cage,
and find out what's happening in Harbinger House. Other-
wise, the cultists will die, slashed by the shadow of the
Lady. While such a catastrophe won't stop the PCs from
defeating Nari and Sougad and restoring Harbinger House
to the Godsmen, it does deny them experience points for
saving the cultists.

ESCAPE FROM CURS+

The second part of Pastor Browen’s trap is sprung the mo-
ment the PCs try to leave Curst. The only conventional
way out of town is through the Wall Watch-defended entry
gate. (The only known planar gate within the town leads to
Carceri, and even if the PCs could find and activate it, that
plane is even harder to escape from than Curst.) If the PCs
try to fly or climb over the wall, the razorvine simply
grows to match their progress. The town won't let its
charges out so easily.

When the PCs approach the entry gate, Sergeant Qarz
and his bashers are on duty. The Wall Watch asks the usual
questions (“Where do you think you're going? Da you know
how to get there? Do you have the means?"}, listens impa-
tiently to the answers, and refuses to let the PCs pass. “The
gate’s closed till tomorrow,” Sergeant Qarz says. “Come
back after lunch and maybe we'll open it then.”

If the PCs don’t have a key for a gate back to Sigil, or
if they don't even know where to find such a gate, none of
this matters. The Wall Watch won't let them out unless
they have somewhere else to be and a way to get there.
Even if they can prove that Curst can't hold them, the PCs
have to deal with the corrupt sergeant and his loyal bash-
ers. Battle is the obvious solution, but other methods for
foiling this part of the trap include:
