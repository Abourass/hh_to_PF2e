Once Trolan of Ecstasy, now Trolan the Mad (and later
Trolan the Beloved), the bard has one great love in his
life. Unfortunately, it's a love that could kill him: Trolan
is devoted to the Lady of Pain. As any berk can tell you,
no one worships Sigil’s high-up in any manner. To do so
brings down her wrath and sends the offending sod off to
his final reward. Such warnings never deterred Trolan,
though. He first heard about the Lady as a young bard in
the gate-town of Ecstasy. What other berks spoke of in
careful whispers, Trolan shouted in the light of day. He
composed songs to the Lady, wrote sonnets, and took
every story he could find and turned them into epic
poems.

Trolan traveled to the Cage six years ago and soon
found a tavern to perform in. Much to the owner's dis-
may, the young tiefling sang a song of love to the Lady of
Pain — going so far as to name her not once, but nine
times before the song was done. The crowd fled in terror
and the tavern owner threw the bard into the street, fully
expecting the Lady's shadow to swallow Trolan whole.
Nothing happened, however, and Trolan walked off into
the night.

It wasn't long before no inn or drinking hall would let
Trolan within 50 feet of the door, let alone inside to per-
form. The Harmonium wouldn't let him sing the Lady's
praises in the streets, and the Mercykillers were preparing
to deal out their own form of punishment when the dabus
surrounded the bard and took him away. What the factions
don't know is that the dabus took him to Harbinger House
and placed him in the Godsmen’s care. Trolan’s got a nat-
ural healing ability that mends his body; the dabus hoped
the faction could mend the tiefling’s mind. The Godsmen,
of course, saw Trolan as a power-to-be, a barmy worthy of
study and care.

To gain Trolan’s help, Nari — who's taken command
of the House — appeared to him in the guise of the Lady of
Pain. She claimed to love him as much as he
loved her, and asked him to spread the word: The
Lady wanted to be loved and worshiped by the

masses. It was up to Trolan to show them how by forming
the cult called Those Who Court the Lady. ‘Course, Trolan
doesn't realize he’s just a pawn in Nari’s game. By divert-
ing the attention of the real Lady of Pain, the cult should
keep her from messing up Nari’s plans.

After learning of Harbinger House, Nari contacted an old
friend back in the Abyss — Crimjak, for whom she'd lured
many mortals to that chaotic evil plane. She told Crimjak
that the time had come for him to repay a bit of his debt.
Nari claimed he'd be rewarded many times over for help-
ing her, as her goal was to push the House — a place full of
magical planar energy — into the Abyss. ‘Course, she left
out the part about her becoming a new power, figuring
that Crimjak didn't need to know everything.

This feisty cutter’s the chief investigator assigned by the
Harmonium to look into the recent string of murders in the
Cage. A tough, no-nonsense Hardhead, Narcovi loves to
get the really difficult cases. She sees them as challenges
befitting her investigative skills, and when a case comes
her way, she throws everything she has into finding the
solution. For this particular case, Narcovi's got eight Hard-
head agents backing her up, and a dozen more
searching the wards for clues, witnesses,
and weird rumors that might lead her to
the killer.

Harbinger House can begin in any number of
ways, depending on where the PCs finished up
their last adventure. A few sample

follows a number
of paths that take the
PCs throughout the Lower
Ward and The Lady’s Ward. A series of grisly murders has the wards up in
arms when the adventure starts. As the PCs get drawn into the plot, they
also discover other strange happenings in the Cage. The dabus, for example,
are acting in peculiar fashion: cleaning areas that aren‘t dirty, fixing things
that aren't broken, and generally behaving nervously. What's more, a new
cult has recently appeared in the Cage, one with an unusual object of affec-
tion: the Lady of Pain. No one knows why the Lady hasn't put them all in
the dead-book already, but that doesn’t stop folks from speculating (some
even suggest her lack of a brutal response means she approves of the

worship).
| This chapter ends with a confrontation with Sougad, the
barmy committing the murders. The PCs and Sougad

catch glimpses of the moving ceremony of love and
devotion. But Sougad escapes through a portal before he can be
defeated, and at that moment the PCs witness the arrival of the
Lady of Pain. Her shadow passes over the park, and every barmy it touches
receives bloody wounds from the outline of her bladed countenance

QUICK St+tAR+ I: REtURN TRIP

This scene begins the adventure just as the PCs return to Sigil from a trip
across the planes. They emerge from a portal to discover that things aren't
exactly the way they remember them. For this quick start to be effective, the
PCs must return through a portal in the Lower Ward or The Lady's Ward.
Preferably, the portal should be near Harbinger House, as that’s the area
where the strange activities of the dabus are most concentrated. Read:

<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-03 -->

While less dramatic in some ways than the other quick starts, the hints pro
vided here could prove even scarier in the long run. What could cause the
usually unflappable dabus to behave so strangely? And what does such be-
havior bode for the future?

The PCs should also notice that other passersby are totally ignoring the
dabus, acting as though the Lady's servants perform senseless work everyday. If the PCs ask

any of the passersby about the dabus, a bariaur comments, tev've been working on tl
1 mo Leer I T Heen Ou t ' ’ 2 ) vue aga
ise next.” No matter ‘how many people the P Cs ask, they receive the

same answer: Th 1ere’s nothing unusual going on. However, any PCs who make a successful Wisdom
check while questioning the crowd notice that the passersby seem a bit nervous. They're
hiding it well, but there’s a tension in their voices, their postures, and the way
their eyes move back and forth. Any PC who makes the check by more than 5
realizes just what the tension is — fear.

lf the PCs try to question the dabus, they get nowhere. The dabus routinely
ignore the presence of others, and at this point in the adventure the PCs are no exception. No mat
ter how hard the PCs try, they can’t get the dabus to notice them. If they stand in the way. the dabus
step around them. If they place themselves in front of the wall, the dabus paint over them as though
they were just another part of the scenery. Eventually, the PCs should take the hint and move on.

If the PCs are foolish enough to attack the dabus, they do get a response: The dabus descend
upon them with the wrath and fury normally reserved for enemies of Sigil and the Lady of Pain
Once one of the PCs falls, the dabus cease their attack — if the remaining PCs do likewise. Otherwise,
it might be time to roll up new characters, because enough dabus can be summoned to put down
even the most powerful PC party.

‘ [he strange behavior exhibited by the dabus is a symptom of the illness affect
ing the Cage. Until Nari’s threat is ended and Trolan has been returned to Harbinger House, the dabus
continue to reflect the unexplained nervousness of the Lady of Pain. While the Lady knows that
something's wrong in the city, she can’t locate the trouble due to the piesking effects of the focriua
However, she senses the energy gathering in Sigil. Sougad’s ritual, Nari’s manipulations, even
Tralan’s exploits — all of these events are leading to the birth of a new power. Powers are usually
sealed off from Sigil, but what happens if one is created in the Cage? The Lady doesn’t know the
specifics, but she is concerned, and, as a result, the dabus are almost frightened.

After this initial scene, the PCs should be introduced to news of the murders. One of
the follow-up scenes described later in this chapter (or even “Quick Start I” or “Quick Start HI") can
be used to draw the PCs deeper into the story. If the DM uses a different opening for the adventure,
the dabus’ strange paint job can still be played out later, as the PCs explore the Cage.

QUICK SFAR+ II;
RELAXING IN tHE CAGE

over To vour table may explain why. “A nother body was
Sound,” the woman says, eliciting oaths and curses from the
men. “Who was it this time?” one asks. "A Guuner? A
Hardhead? One of us?” The woman raises her hand for si-
lence. "It was Keluk,” she tells them, and each lets out a sor-
rowful sigh. “He was found near the Shattered Temple,
killed like the others,”

This beginning introduces the PCs to the
murders that plague the Lower Ward
and The Lady’s Ward. The murders
began about a week ago, and each
night since one lawfully aligned
faction member has ended up in the
dead-book. Six bodies have been
discovered to date, each from one of
these factions: the Athar, the Believers
Of the Source, the Fraternity of Order,

bers of the Doomguard or the Mercy-

killers have turned up dead yet, both of

these factions believe that it is only a

matter of time until they get hit, too.
The PCs may question the Athar

party or simply finish their meal and

head out into the night. The crux of

the plot has been planted, and

there are plenty of scenes de-

scribed in this chapter for pulling

the PCs deeper into the story. If they do

The female faction member is
harder to talk to than her
male companions, refusing to an-
Swer questions if the PCs have
any specialty priests or paladins
among them. Even if they
don't, she still doesn't
trust strangers, and the
current events have made
her even more Cautious
than usual. She’s wary of being tricked
into something, or of giving away too much
to a rival faction, or of unknowingly speaking
to the murderer — after all, the berk could be anybody!
Still, if nonpriest or nonpaladin PCs strike Up a conversa-

from now. The Lady can hardly refuse to respond to all of
our affection.”

With that, Halelfar strides toward the park.

Back at the shop, if the PCs remind A’kin that he was
about to show them some wondrous item, the arcanaloth’s
face lights up and he calls toward a curtained doorway.
“Balaka, my dear, please bring out the long box on the work
table,” A moment later, a beautiful, red-haired female with
feathery wings steps from behind the curtain, carrying an
oblong box. Balaka (PI/? fiend/O/—/LE), an erinyes, is a
lesser baatezu who works for
A’kin; shy and quiet, she's as un-
usual a fiend as her employer.

The box contains a long
sword of the planes, a blade
with a black jewel in its pom-
mel! that glows with the energy of
the multiverse. It looks as though a
portion of space, complete with stars and glowing gases,
has been trapped within the jewel. However, A’kin won't
identify the sword for what it is, merely commenting on its
beautiful workmanship and noting that it has some minor
enchantments on it. After some haggling, the lowest price
he'll accept is 4,000 gp. If the PCs can't afford his price
now, he'll gladly hold the sword for them until later — for
a small down payment of 100 gp.

The long sword of the planes has the following attack
and damage roll bonuses when used on the specified
planes or against opponents from those planes: Prime Ma-
terial Plane, +1; Inner Planes, +2; Outer Planes, +3; Astral
or Ethereal Planes, +4. However, the PCs must figure out
how the sword works on their own; A’kin claims not to
know.

THe Reat Cuant: A’kin the shopkeeper really is a
friendly fiend. That doesn't mean he doesn’t have his own
agenda, but such intrigues are left to crafty DMs. As far as
this adventure is concerned, A’kin can provide the PCs with
information and supplies they wouldn't normally have ac-
cess to. For example, if they stay on the arcanaloth’s good
side, they can come back to the shop later and ask about
succubi, cambions, or other things that have to do with
fiends. A’kin shouldn't be used to give them all the answers,
but he can provide hints, clues, and information if the PCs
are having trouble, or reward them if they're doing particu-
larly well.

Suppinc THE Bunps: If the DM uses a different opening
sequence, this encounter should still occur early in the ad-
venture. As the PCs wander about the Lower Ward or
specifically search the city for clues, eventually they pass
by The Friendly Fiend. If they ask around, A’kin is de-
scribed as a wonderful and entertaining source of informa-
tion.

DM Note: While the PCs are in the shop, they should
notice that several items for sale (banners, mugs, etc.) fea-

ture the icon of the Abyss: an arrow pointing downward
through the center of an infinity symbol. Don't make it a big
issue; simply mention the icon in passing and allow a PC to
ask A’kin what it means. That way, when the PCs later see
the same icon in Harbinger House, the revelation will have
added significance — and terror.

BUILDING +HE StORY

After one of the three openings gets the PCs into the ad-
venture, the main thrust of this chapter is the murders.
Even if the PCs initially decide to
stay out of the investi-
gation, events happen-
ing around them even-
tually pull them right
into the middle of
things. If the PCs don’t take
the initiative, they can be
come suspects in the Harmonium'’s investigation: they can
be hired by one of the most concerned factions (probably
the Athar or the Guvners) to catch the murderer; or they
might be approached by the Godsmen to capture Sougad
and return him to Harbinger House.

The rest of this chapter is broken down into the fol-

lowing major sections.

 “Getting the Chant” (pp. 17-19), which details
what the PCs might learn from Narcovi (the Har-
monium’s investigator), what they might hear
from the typical sod on the street, and what's
really going on with Sougad’s murderous ritual.

“Scenes of the Crime” (pp. 19-24), which details
encounters at the sites of the first six murders
(committed before the adventure begins).

# “Looking for Clues” (pp. 24-28), which provides
six other related events that might take place dur-
ing the PCs’ investigation of the murders.

“Incidental Encounters” (pp. 28-30), which pro-
vides numerous quick encounters to flesh out the
story and give the PCs hints of things to come.

+ “Sougad and the Lady” (pp. 30-31), which takes
the PCs through the dramatic conclusion to the
chapter.

The DM should not simply move the PCs through each
encounter in the order presented in this chapter. Instead,
let the PCs explore as they wish, and throw in various
scenes as the story seems to call for them. For example, the
PCs can investigate a murder site, then have an incidental
encounter, then investigate two more murder sites, then
have one of the encounters from “Looking for Clues,” and
so on,

Everything should build toward the climax of this
chapter, “Sougad and the Lady,” which takes place once
the PCs track Sougad to his hiding spot in a warehouse.

*l6
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-07 -->

GEt+ING tHE CHAN

However it happens, the PCs do get drawn

into the murder investigation. If they agree to

assist a particular faction (or more than one if their group
has the proper mix of members) and they ask for informa-
tion, they're directed to seek out Narcovi, the special in-
vestigator assigned by the Harmonium to look into the
case. Some factions suggest cooperating with Narcovi;
others urge the PCs to find out what she knows by more
covert means. When the PCs go looking for her, refer to
“Narcovi’s Chant” on page 24 for the full encounter. The
section below merely details what kind of information the
PCs can pick up from her notebook.

GE++ING NARCGOVI'S NO+EBOOK

The PCs can learn a few facts and lots of false rumors con-
cerning the six murders that have occurred over the past
six days just by talking to residents of the Cage. Their best
bet, however, is to get the notes that've been compiled by
Narcovi. They can “borrow” her notebook if they're so in-
clined, but if she catches them they'll jump to the top of
her list of suspects. They can also ask her for the notebook
if they've been hired by a faction allied with the Harmo-
nium (either the Guvners or the Mercykillers).

On page 18 is a handout of a section of Narcovi's
notebook. This lists all of the true details concerning the
first six murders, providing the pertinent information —
the whos, whats, wheres, whens, and possible whys of each
specific death. This page may be photocopied for personal
use and given to the players once their characters learn the
facts (or steal the notebook) in the course of the adventure.
However, the DM shouldn't let the PCs obtain the notebook
until they've spent at least one day looking for clues on
their own — don't make it too easy for them!

‘Course, if the PCs never wind up with the notebook,
the DM can use Narcovi's facts to add true information to
the “embellishments” provided by various locals (see
“Talking to Other Sods,” below).

TALKING +@ @+HER SODS

The PCs can talk to any nonplayer characters the
Dungeon Master wishes to provide, and the DM is encour-
aged to create “extras” on the fly. These should include
the regular mix of street people, shopkeepers, innkeepers,
serving girls, adventurers, city guards, faction members,
and the occasional Clueless basher who might have seen
something that someone else missed. However, no one
who isn’t directly involved in the investigation, didn’t dis-
cover a body, or isn't in a position of authority in the
wards knows all of the true facts of the murders. A partic-
ular extra may know one or two bits of true information,
but the bulk of what he or she gives the PCs is rumor, gos-
sip, or outright fiction. “Quick Start II” (page 14) provides

a few false rumors, but a more comprehensive list
appears below:

* Each body was partially eaten.

* The murderer took a different body part from each
victim.

+ All of the victims were members of a new faction
(called the Overbloods) that’s really an alliance of
multiple factions; the murders are simply a pre-
lude to a full-scale faction war.

+ One victim was still alive when they found him,
and he named his killer. It’s one of the factols, so
a cover-up is underway!

* “I discovered the third body near the Great
Bazaar. Small red worms with black spikes cov-
ered the body like a second set of clothes.”

+ Large quantities of dust and ash were discovered
at each murder site.

+ The murder victims have disappeared from the
Mortuary, and some claim to have seen them
walking around the Lower Ward.

# The murderer doesn’t use a weapon — the wounds
were made with claws and teeth.

# “tl heard a scream, ran into the alley, and saw a
shadowy figure leaning over a poor young
woman. | shouted, and the shadow turned into a
mephit and flew away.”

# There's no murderer. The Lady of Pain’s killing
lawful faction members to show her support of
neutrality and chaos.

The information concerning the first six murders and
the false rumors attached to those murders should be dis-
tributed a little at a time, as the PCs pursue their investiga-
tion.

THE DARK OF +HE MURDERS

Bancho Rake, an evil wizard on the prime world of Toril,
first developed the ritual that Sougad believes will turn
him into a power. ‘Course, the wizard had hoped to become
a power himself, but with a barmy like Sougad Lawshred-
der in the picture, things don’t always work out the way a
body might like.

Rake took Sougad in as a young pup, recognizing the
innate abilities that marked the boy as a special being —
one with the spark of divinity. The wizard spent years de-
veloping an arcane rite, one that required both blood and
planar energy. He planned to travel to Sigil, the city said to
lie at the center of the multiverse. There, Sougad would
spill lawful blood and absorb the resulting chaotic energy.
Then Rake would absorb Sougad’s bursting essence and
become a power of murder and chaos.

Sougad, however, didn't appreciate the implications
of the plan, “After all, the essence is mine,” he thought. “If
anyone becomes a power, it should be me!”

Sougad bided his time, waiting for the wizard to fin-
ish his research. On the day Rake announced they would
be traveling to Sigil, the barmy struck. He killed the wiz-
ard, took the scroll that contained the ritual, and used
Rake’s gate key to travel to the Cage by himself.

Completing the ritual is so important to Sougad that
he’s able to keep his inherently chaotic nature in check just
enough to follow the steps. Make no mistake, berk — if
successful, the ritual will make Sougad a lesser power. But
here's the rest of the chant:

* = The evil ritual can't bestow powerhood on anyone
but Sougad or Trolan, because they already pos-
sess that elusive spark of divinity. It wouldn't
have worked for Rake — and it won't work for
Nari. As for the other so-called “powers-in-the-
making” in Harbinger House, the ritual's effects
are uncertain. (Hey, sod, the multiverse is full of
mysteries.)

+ = This ritual is evil, like Sougad. Anyone who delib-
erately follows its steps should have a matching
alignment — or suffer the consequences of a sud-
den alignment change.

The steps that could make Sougad a power of chaos

and murder are as follows:

# A long sword must be fired in a forge whose fuel
has been tainted with the blood of a chaotic being.
(Sougad’s already done this; see “Murder at Sod
Dirk's Forge,” on page 22.)

* Sougad must use the sword to kill 13 lawful be-
ings on the Outlands (preferably, in Sigil itself).
Each murder releases crimson planar energy; the
sword absorbs that energy and shares it with the
killer. Each victim must receive an exact number
of slashes: the first takes one slash, the second
takes two, etc. Thus, the thirteenth victim must re-
ceive 13 slashes. (By the time the adventure starts,
Sougad’s already killed six of the 13 sods.)

* Sougad must leave each corpse with a piece of
parchment inscribed with these words: “Chaos is
the only law, washed clean in the blood of order.”
The parchment must be of the finest quality, the
ink must be the victim's own blood, and the quill
must be a fresh vrock feather (thus, 13 vrock
feathers are needed).

* = The site of each killing must be prepared with the
components of one of these three spells: confusion
(three nutshells), chaos (a disc of bronze and a
small iron rod), or death spell (a crushed black
pearl worth no less than 1,000 gp). The compo-
nents need to be placed within 10 feet of where
the murder takes place. None of the three spells
are actually cast; the components simply help

+ 19

power the transfer of planar energy and are only
partially consumed in the process.

* Once 13 lawful beings have been killed with the
prepared sword, the sword can then be used to turn
Sougad or Trolan into a true power. The power-to-
be must be slain with the sword. The person's mor-
tal body dies, but the energy accumulated in the
sword transforms him into a lesser power.

When Sougad was freed from Harbinger House, he
took with him the scroll that details the ritual; the PCs
might discover it later (in Chapter III). The barmy’s also
made a slight alteration to the process. The thirteenth mur-
der must take place in the presence of both the planarity
and the focrux, so Sougad plans to return to Harbinger
House to commit the last few murders. Then, he'll plunge
the sword into himself as the powerful energy of the pla-
nar items washes over him.

DM note: With each partial completion of the ritual
(every few victims killed), Sougad receives additional in-
nate powers, as detailed throughout the adventure.
However, he won't become a full power
until he finishes the whole ritual,
and hopefully, the PCs will
stop that from happening.

SCENES OF FHE CRIME

The sites of Sougad’s first six murders are described below.
They appear in the order the murders were committed, but
the PCs can check them out in any order they choose. Re-
member to intersperse scenes from the “Incidental Encoun-
ters” and “Looking for Clues” sections with visits to the
various crime sites.

THE HOVEL ON BLOSD BOIL

The first victim — Old Favur, the former custodian of Har-
binger House — was discovered in a hovel near the House,
Located one block from the House, the hovel is just one of
many small dwellings owned by the Believers of the Source
and used as temporary quarters for members of the faction.

When Favur retired from his post as custodian, he was
assigned to this hovel until arrangements could be made
on the Ethereal Plane for a permanent home. Sougad chose
him as the first victim for two reasons. First, Nari wanted
to get rid of Favur; he'd outlived his usefulness and couldn't
be left alive to tell others about her. Second, when Sougad
spent those long years as a “guest” of the House, the
barmy swore he'd put Favur in the dead-book if ever given
the chance.
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-10 -->

One fact about the first murder that Narcovi's kept se-
cret (but written in her notebook) is the message that was
left at the scene. The words, written across one wall in
Favur's blood, proclaimed, “Now it begins.” If the PCs ques-
tion the other residents of the area, they learn that an old
woman named Eltiva (Pl/2 gnome/0/Sign of One/N), who
worked as Favur's housekeeper and lived two doors away,
was the one who discovered the body. She saw the bloody
message and can tell the PCs about it.

If the PCs search the murder site and any of them
make successful Wisdom checks at -2, they discover two
small objects jammed halfway into a crack in the hovel’s
wall, about 10 feet from where the body was found. These
objects — a small bronze disc and a small iron rod — are the
components for a chaos spell. Both have been partially
consumed to power this portion of the ritual, but enough
remains for the PCs to identify them.

DM Notre: PCs with the spellcraft
proficiency can make an Intelli-
gence check at -6 to identify the
spell from the components (wiz-
ards of 8th level or higher make
the check at -2). Other high-
level wizards, including Kesto
Brighteyes (see “The Parted
Veil Bookshop” on page 22),
can identify the spell and also
determine that the components
were not used in a normal spellcast-
ing attempt.

WAS KILLED.
A REAL

THe BUNKH@USE on POWERS ROW

Two murders have taken place in the shadow of the Shat-
tered Temple. The first occurred five nights ago at an Athar
bunkhouse located on Powers Row. The bunkhouse serves
as living quarters for transient members of the faction and
other Athar bashers who need a place to stay.

On the night in question, only three of the 12 rooms
were occupied: Vienna the bariaur (the victim), Defiant
Munrot (PI/ halfling/O/Athar/CG), and Kuarri the An-
cient (Pl/d tiefling/O/Athar/CN) were using the facilities.
Neither Munrot nor Kuarri had rooms near Vienna, so
what they can tell the PCs is limited. Kuarri found the body
and can provide a few facts. Munrot, on the other hand,
was extremely drunk at the time and barely heard a thing.
Every bit of information he provides is false, as he decided
to make up a complete story rather than admit he heard
and saw nothing.

The bariaur's body was discovered in her straw-filled
sleeping stall. If the PCs conduct their own search (and at
least one PC makes a successful Wisdom check at —4), they
discover two clues that Narcovi missed. A small patch of
black dust stains the otherwise pristine floor beneath the
straw — the remains of the crushed black pearl Sougad used
to power this portion of the ritual. A successful appraising

proficiency check can identify the material; the spellcraft
proficiency (or a high-level wizard contact) can be used to
identify its possible uses. See the DM Nove under “The
Hovel on Blood Boil,” above, for more information.

The second clue is lodged within the straw: a vrock
feather, its tip stained with the bariaur’s blood. Sougad
dropped it in the straw and didn't feel like digging around
to find it. If the PCs have a high-level wizard contact, or if
they're on good terms with A’kin the yugoloth, they can
get the feather and the stain on its tip identified.

THE ASCENSION DRINKING HALL

The third murder victim — the female tiefling Lini — was
discovered in a Godsmen-frequented drinking hall near the
Great Foundry. The Ascension, a high-class establishment
on Gray Steam Path, is noted for
its ethereal ale — a drink that lit-
erally evaporates on the tongue,
quenches thirst, and produces a
soothingly intoxicating effect.
By talking to assorted cus-
tomers, serving wenches, and
the owner, the PCs can
uncover both facts and
rumors at this location.
The owner is Julius
of the Ninth Test (PI/
é githyanki/0/
Believers of the
Source/NE), a Godsman who believes
he's now in his ninth incarnation and getting
increasingly closer to the Final Ascension. Though he's
friendly and answers questions concerning the murder,
he's more interested in spreading the doctrine of the Be-
lievers of the Source. (He can also tell the PCs about Har-
binger House if they specifically question him about the
place, but he won't reveal anything about it during casual
conversation.)

A search of the premises reveals nothing beyond what
Narcovi discovered, as the place has been thoroughly
cleaned. If the PCs press Julius for more details, though, he
remembers picking up three nutshells from beneath the
smashed table where they found poor Lini. The shells are
components for the confusion spell and were used to
power this portion of the ritual. See the DM Note under
“The Hovel on Blood Boil,” above, for ways the PCs can
gain details on the shells.

When the PCs leave The Ascension, the DM should have
each make a Wisdom check at —4. Those who succeed notice
that they're being followed; those who fail see nothing but
still feel as though they're being watched. The follower is a
young boy named Urchend (PI/ human/0/Free League/LN).
He's small, thin, and ragged, but his eyes are bright and alert.
He lives on Sigil's streets and was sleeping in the alley across
from The Ascension on the night of the murder.

NIN+H TES+

<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-11 -->

Urchend is deathly afraid of the Harmonium because
their guards routinely round up street people for no appar-
ent reason, so he hid while Narcovi was conducting her in-
vestigation. He wants to let somebody know what he saw,
however. If the PCs have been friendly toward other street
people, Urchend approaches them; otherwise, the PCs spot
him and can go to his hiding place. In cither case, once the
PCs demonstrate that they mean the boy no harm, Urchend
stammers:

“I spied the killin’ in The Ascension four nights ago. It
was dark, but | saw twa shapes movin’ around behind the
windows, A basher chased a woman around the common
room with a sword, but he weren't swingin’ it at her. I
could hear him laughin’ — an evil, barmy sound. Then he
touched her, and a flash like lightnin’ lit up the room. The
woman screamed, and I saw the berk in that quick flash o°
light. He was tall and strong, with wild hair and fiery eyes.
Then it got dark again. I could hear him hack her to bits
with his sword, but 1 couldn't see nothin’ — at least, not till
! spied a sparkly red glow creep outta her body, slide up his
sword, and make the berk shine bright, just for a wink.”

Urchend didn’t recognize the killer and can’t tell the
PCs anything more.

THe Rear CHANr: The bright flash of light was created
when Sougad used his shocking grasp ability to wound the
woman. Once he'd killed her, planar energy — the red glow
— flowed into his body through the sword.

CI+Y¥Y COUR+F LIBRARY

Fassa, the fourth victim to fall to Sougad’s sword, was a
member of the Fraternity of Order who had the misfortune
to be working late three nights ago. The male human Guv-
ner was in one of the Court's libraries, studying a stack of
scrolls pertaining to the laws of commerce between Sigil
and the merchant lords of the Planar Trade Consortium.
His blood has permanently stained the scrolls.

When the PCs arrive at the City Court, they find that
the library in question has been temporarily closed. If
they're working for the Guvners, the Harmonium, or the
Mercykillers, they're allowed to examine the area. Other-
wise, they must sneak in, charm their way past a Guvner
guard, or bribe one of the non-Guvner workers who serve
the Court. However they do it, the PCs should eventually
gain access to the murder site. In the library, the PCs wit-
ness the following:

Pushing open the doors to the Court library, you're
greeted with an unexpected sight. AU of the shelves of
scrolls and books have been shoved into the far corner,
along with the reading tables and choirs. The rest of the
chamber is bare, and four dabus are busy cleaning the
walls, floor, and ceiling with brushes, mops, and brooms.

“They've been at it since we removed the body two
days ago,” comments a voice from behind you. You turn
with @ start, recognizing the old man with the large red
nose and bushy white mustache as Factol Hashkar, high-
up of the Gueners. “lve never seen them behave like this,
cleaning the same spots over and over. It doesn’t bode well
for the Cage, | fear. But enough about our stlent
friends. Do you have
some business here, or
should | summon
my guards?”

Factol Hash-
kar (PI(?)/ dwarf/o/
Fraternity of Order/LN) has
come to this library every two
hours to watch the dabus repeat
their cleaning ritual. He's frightened
because something has unbalanced
the Lady’s order — an order the dabus usually
represent. If the PCs aren't working for the factol
yet, he asks them questions concerning their inter-
est in the murders and their presence in a chamber
that is off-limits to the general public. If the PCs show him
the proper respect, answer truthfully, and don’t act too
chaotically, the factol asks them to work for the Fraternity
of Order. “Stop the killer, and maybe the madness that has
claimed the City of Doors will dissipate.”

The dabus have cleaned up everything pertaining to
the murder, including the small pile of black pearl dust
used in the ritual. However, on a successful Wisdom
check, one of the PCs notices that one of the dabus has
split off from his fellows. He’s working among the books
that have been pushed aside, and is, in fact, cleaning the
same book over and over again. If the PCs approach, the
dabus allows them a few moments to inspect the tome; it’s
titled Powers and Demipowers. Bloodstains mar the pages
of a chapter titled “Divine Ascension.” (Sougad skimmed
the chapter after murdering Fassa; the dabus noticed the
residue of evil left behind.)

DM Nore: If the PCs are leatherheaded enough to at-
tack the dabus, use the following statistics for the four in
the library. However, be aware that enough dabus can be
summoned to easily kill or incapacitate the PCs if things
start getting out of hand.

NARCOVI,

L@@SKING FOR CLUES

As the PCs search the Lower Ward and The Lady’s Ward for
clues concerning the murders, they're likely to run into the
six encounters in this section. These scenes should be in-
terspersed with scenes of the PCs checking out the murder
sites and run in the order that makes the most sense to the
way the adventure is progressing.

DM Nove: The DM may expand this section to include
other encounters as he sees fit.

NARCOVI'S CHANF

In her search for the killer, the Harmonium investigator
Narcovi's got a squad of eight Hardhead agents backing
her up, and plenty more nosing around the wards.

Several of these agents run into the PCs while they're
conducting their own search of the murder sites (though
who the PCs are working for. if anyone, may determine

what kind of reception Narcovi gives them later). The
Hardheads ask questions along the following lines: “Where
were you last night around eighth lantern? What business
do you have here? Can we take a look at your swords? Did
you know the victim? Why are you so interested in a cou-
ple of routine murders?” The agents give the PCs a tough
time, then wander off into the turns and twists of the Cage.

The Hardheads report to Narcovi as soon as they can,
letting her know that a group of rough-looking berks is
nosing around the murder sites. Narcovi gathers her agents
and tries to locate the PCs, finding them at some point be-
fore the first day of the adventure ends.

Narcovi's been running into walls and dead-ends since
this case began, so she’s not going to be too nice to a bunch
of adventurers who may know who the murderer is. Fact is,
as far as Narcovi knows, one of the PCs could be the killer.

If the player characters are working for the Guvners,
the Harmonium, or the Mercykillers, Narcovi goes a little
easier on them. Otherwise, she treats them like suspects
and asks tough questions. Some are the same ones her
agents asked earlier, while others are more to the point:
“Where have you been all day? Yesterday? Did anyone else
see you there? What about six nights ago? Five? Four? Can
you prove it? Why shouldn't I call the Merevkillers and

have the bunch of you thrown into a very dark cor-
ner of the Prison?”

If the PCs refuse to cooperate, Narcovi has her
agents haul them down to the City Barracks, where she can
conduct a more thorough interview. ‘Course, this could
lead to a fight. While the agents are tough, the PCs should
be able to escape if they try. In no case should Narcovi be
killed during any such skirmishes. If a fight does break out,
the PCs automatically become fugitives wanted for ques-
tioning by the Harmonium. From that point on, they'll
have to be careful not to get spotted by any of Sigil’s three
spokes of justice — the Guvners, the Hardheads, or the Red
Death — as members of these factions will be on the alert
for anyone answering to the PCs’ descriptions.

Unless the PCs are connected to one of the three fac-
tions mentioned above, Narcovi refuses to let them help
her and won't share any of the evidence she’s gathered, in-
cluding the information in her notebook (on page 18). The
PCs see her jot notes down, though, and they might get the
idea to swipe the notebook at the next convenient oppor-
tunity. ‘Course, once she notices it’s missing, Narcovi
comes looking for the PCs to confront them about it.

If the PCs answer all of Narcovi's questions honestly
and with some modicum of respect, she'll let them go with
a simple warming. “/ don't know where you come from, bur
in Sigil it's the Harmonium that makes the arrests. Stay
out of this and you'll stay healthier — and Jree~

XA@SIFECt HIDEOUT

More than one lawful berk thinks that the Xaositects are
behind the murders. Factol Karan has asked his Chaosmen
to keep an eye on the events transpiring in the Lower Ward
and The Lady's Ward, sensing that if the law-boys don't
break the case soon, his faction is going to take the heat.
Something this big could lead to a faction war, and even
Karan isn't chaotic enough to want that. So, as the PCs
carry out their own investigation, they may see a Xaositect
or two spying from the shadows, sitting inconspicuously
just within earshot, or even boldly approaching to ask
them what they learned at a particular location.

If the PCs decide to turn the tables
on the Xaositects and do some
following of their own, they'll be
led right to the Xaositect hideout in
the Lower Ward. It's not too far from Har-
binger House (the Chaosmen really want to dis-
cover the dark of that place), hidden in the base-
ment of a sweets shop called Happy Candies (marked on
one of the DM's maps of Sigil). The jumble of candies
mixed randomly among a dozen bins is a clue that the shop
is run by Chaosmen. The berk (Pld githzerai/0/Xaositects/
CN) behind the counter makes for an interesting encounter.
Prices change from moment to moment, conversation flows
from topic to topic without any discernible pattern, and at
times the shopkeeper even switches to the meaningless dia-
logue often used by members of this faction.

A trap door behind the counter leads down to the
hideout. The PCs can try to convince the shopkeeper that
they are members of the faction (which isn’t hard unless
any PCs wear obvious icons of other factions or lawful
holy symbols), overpower the poor berk, or simply wait
until the place closes and break in.

The basement is one large room, with cots scattered
everywhere, a table and six chairs in one corner, and a
small fire providing light. At any given time, four to nine
(1d6+3) Chaosmen are present. Besides trying to get to the
bottom of the murders themselves, these Chaosmen are
preparing to defend themselves against attacks by other
factions. The hideout is full of weapons they've gathered,
including: 12 long swords, 16 short swords, eight spears,
eight flasks of oil, 10 torches, 24 arrows, three short bows,
and nine daggers (none of the weapons are magical). The
PCs may see the weapons as “proof” that the Chaosmen
are committing the murders, or as a response to the brutal
accusations being made.

If the PCs enter the hideout in the company of a
Chaosman PC or the shopkeeper (if they peeled him into
believing they're faction members, for example), the
Xaositects are willing to talk.

However, if the PCs barged in on their own, the
Xaositects are hostile, thinking the group's come to arrest
or attack them. The Chaosmen fight to the death, though
one tries to escape to warn the rest of the faction. The PCs

must fight to the end or convince the Chaosmen they've
come in peace. The trick here is to discover that the Chaos-
men, in their own way, are as upset about the murders as
the lawful factions are. If the PCs learn that the Chaosmen
aren't behind the killings, they can help keep a faction war
from erupting by passing the word along to Factol Ambar
or Narcovi.

TALC WAREH@USES

Three warehouses in the area deal in talc, the substance the
PCs may find on Harmonium Street (if they spot Sougad)
and at The Parted Veil bookshop. Penbrum’s Parchments
and Papers, Logu's Bath Powder, and Grossif’s Paints each
have a warehouse in the area, and each make extensive use
of talc. The warehouses are marked on the DM’s maps of
Sigil. Their locations are not secret, and the PCs should be
able to find them without much trouble. For example,
Kesto Brighteyes or another PC contact can direct the
group to any of the three.

PENBRUM'S PARCHMENTS AND PAPERS: Penbrum's Parchments
and Papers has a large warehouse in The Lady's Ward, not
far from the City Court. Most of the paper used by the
Court comes from Penbrum'’s stores. If the PCs check out
the warehouse, they must get past a complicated series of
locks (-20% penalty to open lock rolls). However, a thor-
ough search of the exterior of the building reveals another
entrance: A loose board near the base of the back wall
slides sideways to form a small but usable entrance. Only
human-sized or smaller creatures can squeeze through the
opening.

Inside the warehouse, a pack of cranium rats has
made a nest in the paper stores. There are 40 rats in the
pack, which has a collective Intelligence of 8 and two wiz-
ard spells (color spray and hypnotism). The pack has noth-
ing to do with the murders but reacts badly to anything
that threatens the nest. If the PCs enter the warehouse and
start looking around, the rats stalk them and wait for op-
portunities to strike. If Penbrum is informed about the rat
infestation, he offers the PCs a reward of 500 gold pieces
for clearing out his warehouse.

Logu's Bar Powper: Logu’s Bath Powder provides its prod-
ucts to the bath houses frequented by the Ciphers. The
business has one warehouse in the vicinity, a medium-
sized building in the Lower Ward, not far from the Armory.
Casks and boxes of powder made from talc fill the interior
in orderly rows. If the PCs decide to explore this location,
they discover that someone's living in the warehouse. Near
the back, far from the norma! traffic of the workers, a
smal! den has been built. Casks and boxes make up the
walls, while barrels form a crude table and chair. A bed of
straw has been laid out in one corner. There are also the
remains of recent meals, four empty wine skins, a few odds
and ends, and a leather purse with the initials “LC” and the
embroidered symbol of the Godsmen.

The purse belonged to Lini, the third victim. It was left
at the murder site by Sougad and later picked up by Baskix
Three-Fingers (P!/ gnome/0/Free League/CN), a homeless
drunk who's been secretly living in this warehouse for the
past few weeks. He discovered Lini’s body in The Ascen-
sion while on his way home from a cheaper drinking hall.
Since the berk was already dead and there wasn't anyone
around, Baskix took her purse and headed back to the
warehouse. The PCs should be able to quickly determine
that the drunk is harmless and incapable of killing anyone
in the method that’s been used thus far. However, Baskix
can provide one additional bit of information about the
third murder; he shows the PCs a vrock feather he found at
the tavern, its tip stained with dried blood.

Grossir’s Paints: This warehouse is located in the Lower
Ward near Harbinger House, not far from Bloodgem Park.
{f the PCs take a look around inside, they find Sougad’s
lair. Skip to “Sougad and the Lady” on page 30 for the
conclusion of this chapter of the adventure.

SPELL COMPONEN+S

If the PCs follow the spell component angle, they can
learn quite a lot about their quarry. A number of shops
that cater to the arcane arts — including The Friendly
Fiend — are marked on the DM's maps of Sigil on the
gatefold screen. It’s up to the DM to create the encoun-
ters if the PCs decide to visit any or all of these places.
The PCs might also visit any shops introduced in previ-
ous adventures or seek out contacts they've used before.

Sougad purchased 13 sheets of the finest parchment
from Unrra’s Arcana. Each sheet bears three Ps — the wa-
termark of Penbrum’s Parchments and Papers. If the PCs

describe Sougad (based on conversations with Kesto
Brighteyes or Urchend), the shopkeeper (PI/d tiefling/0/
Transcendent Order/NE) recalls the man. “A creepy fellow.
A perfect gentleman one moment, an abusive sod the next.
He did pay in gold, though.”

The clerk (Pr/3 elf/0/Society of Sensation/LG) at an-
other shop, The Wizard's Mark, doesn't remember anyone
matching Sougad's description, but his store was broken
into six nights back. “/t was the oddest thing. Broke in as
bold as a balor and (ook 13 vrock feathers from the jar over
there. Nearly cleaned me out. As it ts, the berk lefi me with
only neo. Oh, ves, Ure thief also lifted 12 nutshells, five
bronze dises, and five tron rods.”

Where did Sougad get the black pearls? From The
Sleepy Dwarf Gem Exchange, of course. “Black pearis?”
the dwarf (PI/d dwarf/0/Fated/LN) behind the counter
asks. “Wi ure you interested in black pearls?” The dwarf
is suspicious because the last time someone came into his
shop and asked to see his black pearls, he was robbed dur-
ing the night. “Tall, powerfully built, with wild hair and

fiery eyes.” the dwarf remembers. “I’m sure if was him.

Came in seven days ago. He asked specifically to look at

HARLIQUE +HE BARMY

Sometime before nightfall on the first day of the PCs’ in-
vestigation, a barmy from Harbinger House approaches to
warn them about the impending seventh murder. If the PCs
heed her advice, they may be able to stop the crime; how-
ever, if they ignore her, they'll have to deal with the fact
that everything she told them later comes true.

The barmy is Harlique Swifthand (Pl/ 2 tiefling/B1/—/
CN), a young woman who carries herself as a carefree,
fun-loving teenager but is haunted by terrible nightmares
that strike even while she’s awake. These nightmares are
always prophetic in nature, showing her visions of grue-
some events just before they actually take place. Because
her visions come true, she was taken in by the Godsmen of
Harbinger House, instead of winding up in the Hive. How-
ever, when Nari let Trolan and Sougad free, Harlique used
her thieving abilities to escape.

At this point in the adventure, she’s experienced each
of the six murders through nightmares before the crimes
took place. Last night, while the sixth murder was taking
place, she dreamed the events of the seventh murder — the
death of Kolz, the Mercykiller.

When the PCs meet Harlique, she looks as if she hasn't
slept well in weeks. The DM should pick one of the PCs.
Harlique saw that character battling Sougad in her dream
and wants to enlist his aid. She approaches the group with a
dance in her step but a haunted look in her eyes. She behaves
like any other barmy they might meet, but an edge of sanity
peeks through if the PCs look for it. Read the following:

DM Norte: If Sougad successfully slashes Kolz seven
times, the PCs witness the transfer of planar energy — a red
glow seems to be sucked out of the corpse, pour into
Sougad’s sword, and dissipate throughout the barmy’s
whole body.

SuPPING THE BLINDS: If the PCs don't discover Sougad's
hideout in the talc warehouse (Grossif's Paints) by the sec-
ond night of the adventure, the DM must determine an-
other target from the possible factions listed in the “Intro-
duction” for an eighth victim (or a ninth, if a PC was also
killed). If the PCs still haven't found Sougadl’s hideout by
the third night of the adventure, the DM should steer the
group toward the conclusion of the chapter — allow an

NPC to provide hints, bring forward a witness
who's spotted someone living in the
warehouse, and so on.

INCIDENTAL ENCOUNTERS

As the PCs travel through the Lower Ward and The Lady's
Ward in search of the murderer, the DM should use these
incidental encounters to add flavor to Sigil, demonstrate
the odd behavior of the dabus, and provide hints concern
ing events that'll take place in Chapter Il and Chapter mM.
The DM should also feel free to add other encounters tO
this mix as he sees fit.

MURDER A+ S@D DIRK’S FORGE

The first murder Sougad actually committed upon being
set free from Harbinger House was the one needed to pre-
pare his long sword for the ritual. He found a forge. 4 long
sword, and a chaotic being at Sod Dirk's Forge- Sod Dirk,
a half-elf who was working late on a commission for
Kaldoron of Ysgard, never saw the attack coming. Sougad
used his shocking grasp to knock Dirk out. Then, using the
long sword Dirk was working on, he killed the half-elf and
spilled his blood into the fire.
No one has connected this murder with the others
since the victim was not lawful, but the PCs could hear
i from a number of sources. Kaldoron (Pi
3 siwart/F5/Mercykillers/LG), in particular, has been moan-
ing about the loss of his long sword in the local taverns.

INDEP BASHERS

Sometime during the PCs’ investigation of the murders,
Nari the succubus learns of their involvement. While she
isn't particularly concerned about cutters like them, she
doesn’t want to take any chances. So she approaches 4

group of Indep bashers in human form and spins 4 sad
tale. “The cutters attacked me ‘cause | don't pelong to 4
faction,” Nari cries, letting her tears flow freely- “They took
my coin pouch and said they'd find me later so they could
have some more fun.” This really makes the bashers mad;
to them, it’s just another sign of the indignities that all In-
deps must suffer. The Indeps decide to teach the PCs.a les-
son — which is exactly how Nari hoped they'd respond.

Ten Indep bashers soon find the PCs and get right to
the point. Read:

You suddenly find yourselves surrounded by fen of the
meanest bashers you "pe ever seen. They wear the symbol of
the Free League, which means anyone could have hired
them fo come after you. “You berks need to learn some
manners, one of the bashers sneers as he hefts his
weapon. “And while we're teaching you, maybe you'd like
to return the lady's pouch and save yourselves 4 secon
beating.”

The bashers don't want to kill the PCs, but they will
match force for force. If more than half of the bashers fall,
the rest try to escape. If the PCs manage to capture an
Indep for questioning, he tells them all about what Nari
said. However, he can't name her, he doesn't know how to
find her, and the description fits any number of young
women in the Cage-

S+RANGE DABUS

The PCs have already seen some of the strange behavior
exhibited by the dabus. The following examples can also
be sprinkled throughout the rest of the encounters in this

@ On one street, a group of dabus slice away OF hack
through razorvine. The PCs have seen the dabus
perform this function before; it’s one of their main

jobs in Sigil. However this time there jsn’t any Ta-
zorvine in sight. The dabus have already cut and
collected the plant from this area, but they con-
tinue to work at it as though the street was COV~
ered with the nasty growth.

@ On another street, a group of dabus g0 through
the motions of trapping and killing vermin. How-
ever, there are no vermin present — only the
dabus who endlessly track, bag; and kill nonexis-
tent creatures.

@ The dabus work to repair things that aren't bro-
ken. They repave cobbled streets, hammer nails
into solid boards, and replace intact windows with

glass as the nervous crowds pass by-

<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-19 -->

Finally, there are many possible examples of the
dabus cleaning areas that already sparkle. They sweep un-
seen dust from the streets, scrub unseen dirt from walls,
and wash windows that already shine. They are especially
active in the vicinity of Harbinger House and around the
murder sites.

DM Nort: If the PCs attack the dabus, use the follow-
ing statistics, keeping in mind that enough dabus can be
summoned to easily put the PCs down.

At+ACK ON
FAC+@L AMBAR

Nari wants the planarity, which means she has to find a
way to get it from Factol Ambar. Since Sougad escaped
and the murders began, the factol’s surrounded himself
with a collection of guards. However, Nari’s called in a
favor from Crimjak, the marquis cambion, and employed
him to help steal the planarity.

While investigating the murder site at The Ascension
drinking hail, the PCs hear the sounds of a nearby battle; if
they don’t respond immediately, shouts for help reach their
ears. When they do arrive at the scene of the fight, they see
Crimjak making short work of Facto! Ambar's personal
guards, having already taken down half and steadily work-
ing his way through the remaining bashers.

During the confusion, a thief charmed by Nari gets
close to Ambar (PI/ half-elf/R20/Believers of the Source/
NG) and plucks the planarity — pouch and all — from the
factol’s belt. Crimjak continues the fight until the thief,
Tarrin, has a chance to steal the item and get away. The
factol notices the red-haired young man but thinks noth-
ing of his presence while the battle rages.

If the PCs rush to help the guards, together their
power can drive off the cambion, who gladly teleports
away anyway as soon as Tarrin's escaped with the pla-
narity. Afterward, when Ambar notices that the artifact is
missing, he remembers how close the red-haired stranger
got. He provides the PCs with an accurate description and
promises to reward them if they can recover the pouch and
its contents. He also gives them each 100 gp for the aid
they provided his guards.

THt Reat CuAnt: Ambar won't divulge much about
the planarity beyond a physical description, but he does
tell the PCs that the item itself will be able to identify the
thief — a subtle reference to its power to record and store
images.

SuPPING THE Bunos: If the PCs don’t participate in this
encounter, the DM should assume that it takes place any-
way, and that the planarity ends up in Nari’s hands.

THE THIEF AGAIN

Nari wants to frame the PCs for a murder that looks re-
markably like one Sougad would commit. She plans to
charm a basher into killing a lawful sod with three sword
slashes and leave behind an item stolen from one of the
PCs.

A few hours after the attack on Facto! Ambar, Tarrin
the thief tries to steal something from the PCs as
they walk through Sigil’s streets — any item that
can be traced back to the group. If the PCs catch

him in the act, they can question him about the ob-
ject he stole from Factol Ambar. Tarrin doesn’t know a
lot, and it’s obvious that he’s been charmed in some way.
He doesn’t know Nari's name, where to find her, or what
she did with the item. Read:

“I don't have it,” the thief savs with a wide smile. “I
gave it to the beautiful woman, She wanted it so badly, I

Just had to get it for her. The same's true of your item. Let

me give it to her!”

Tarrin does know he’s supposed to meet “her” in
Bloodgem Park after completing his present mission. If the
PCs go to the park, Nari spots them from her hiding place
in the shadows of a copse of trees and realizes that Tartin
has failed. She disappears before the PCs even realize she’s
there.

On the other hand, if Tarrin successfully steals an item
from the PCs, Narcovi returns to see them the next day to
discuss why an item of theirs was found at the scene of an-
other murder victim.
