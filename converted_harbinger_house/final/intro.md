A lot of barmy things happen in the Cage.

That's just the nature of a place that’s connected

to everywhere and serves as a waystation for
planewalkers from every corner of the multiverse. Still, a cutter knows that
AN he can count on a certain amount of stability, even in a place like Sigil. Take
the dabus, for instance. They repair what's bro-
ken, cut back the evergrowing razorvine, and
| rl = pry D YU C wis | ty r otherwise serve as cryptic workers weaving their
way through the streets of the city. ‘Course,
some berks learn there's more to the dabus when
they threaten Sigil’s high-up, the Lady of Pain.
Then the dabus arrive as the Lady's agents, swift to punish. Either way,

there's a degree of comfort in their ever-present activities.

But what if something bad were to happen
something so foul and evil that even
the dabus came to know fear?
That's when
cutters and
bloods should
pack up and
head out, ‘cause
something that threat-
ens the Lady and makes even
the dabus nervous must be sodding awful — and everybody knows there's still
plenty of room in the dead-book for the careless. the foolish, and the brave.

THE TALE oF
HARBINGER HOUSE

“It shelters those who are still developing,” factol Ambar of the Godsmen
explained to the new custodian as they walked along one of Sigil’s cobbled

EE streets. The woman beside him was Bereth, chosen from among the best the

ENC faction had to offer for the skills and compassion she possessed. “These are

the forerunners of the next generation of powers,” he continued, “a small

— FAC+@EL AMBAR group of individuals who have been mistaken for barmies by the rest of Sigil.
er+kHe GODSMEN We, however, know better.”

They walked in silence for a time, neither one speaking as they traveled
from the Foundry toward the oldest section of the Lower Ward. The buildings
in this area pressed in upon them, and the narrow streets became less
crowded with every new turn they made. Bereth felt as though sinister eyes
were watching her, but the factol was calm, and she didn't want to appear
nervous or afraid while in his presence. She followed him onto an ancient
street, set off by a spiky wall of stone and razorvine. It was a dead-end, she
knew, and at its deepest point their destination waited.

“Sometimes the pressures of evolving to the next level take a toll on the
powers-to-be,” the factol said as he led her toward the structure at the end
of the block. “Sometimes we must care for these ascenders, keep them well
until the process reaches its conclusion. And we do that here, in Harbinger
House.”

Bereth let loose the breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding when
the House came into view. It was always “the House,” with a capital “H”
and a tone of wonder. It was huge, more like a mansion than a home, but its
architecture was as mad as the inhabitants sheltered within its tilted walls.
With its haphazard towers, leaning sides, and jumble of doors, windows,
and staircases, it was a structure right out of a Xaositect’s dreams — or a
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-2 -->

| ae

Guvner's nightmares. There
didn't seem to be a single right angle in
sight. Instead, the House was built of obtuse and
acute angles that made some walls lean crazily for-
ward while others pulled in upon themselves. It was
unnerving, but Bereth could also feel the power ema-
nating from the place.

“It's as old as the Cage itself. and as enigmatic,” factol Ambar noted,
standing beside Bereth in the shadow of the House. Its dark windows stared
down at them with silent regard, but its many doors remained closed. Bereth tried to
follow the course of an exterior staircase with her eyes, but it hurt to look at the House
too long or too hard. “Inside you will see majesty and mystery, and as you help the powers-
to-be recognize themselves and climb to the next stage of existence, you also will ascend.”

Bereth remembered the other thing the Godsmen always said about Harbinger House. “Within its
twisted halls and random chambers waits the ultimate answer to the tests of the multiverse,” the
chant went. “Find that answer, and the Final Ascension will be at hand.”

However, before either factol or custodian could approach the House's main entrance, the front
door swung open and a disheveled Godsman stumbled out. “factol Ambar,” the Godsman called, “it's
terrible! Terrible! Two of our charges — they've slipped the blinds, given us the laugh!"

“Who, man? Tell me!” factol Ambar demanded. Bereth’s blood turned cold.

“Trolan, factol Ambar,” the Godsman stammered, “and Sougad. By the Source of All, Sougad
Lawshredder has escaped!”

Lawshredder — the name Bereth had imagined. Fear exploded within her like the fires of Dis,
filling her with dread instead of heat. She looked to her factol for comfort but found in his face only
terror. Above them, the House seemed to lean closer, like a vulture peering down to see if its meal had
stopped twitching. The Final Ascension had never felt as unattainable as it did at that moment. Or as
distant. ...

BACKGROUND

This section gives a Dungeon Master (DM) enough information to grasp what's really going on in the
adventure. It includes an overview of Harbinger House; what's already happened to bring the story
to the point at which the adventure begins; the dark of the planarity and the focrux, mysterious items
of great power; and the roles played by the barmies Sougad and Trolan in the unfolding plot.

THE HOUSE

Harbinger House sits on a quiet, dead-end street in the Lower Ward (though some claim it’s in The
Lady's Ward), towering above the neighboring buildings. Its multiple levels rise in all directions,
piled haphazardly atop each other like blocks placed by a demented child. Walls tilt at insane angles,
and dark windows reflect the lantern light of the nearby hovels. Staircases climb and descend around
the House like latticework adornments. Some reach toward entryways, others lead nowhere. Finally,
and perhaps most important, are the doors. Doors of all sizes and descriptions fill the walls of Har-
binger House, inside and out — ornate doors, plain doors, elaborate open arches, simple sealed por-
tals, doors of wood and stone and brass, and more. Doors are everywhere, and they're almost all
locked tight.

Harbinger House is a place of power, a nexus of energy, almost like a smaller version of Sigil it-
self. Its doors, like the portals of the Cage, open into the multiverse — if a berk has the proper key.
But the key to the doors of Harbinger House is harder to come by than the keys that open the Cage.
And there's good reason for that. The House shelters some of Sigil’s most prominent barmies, so the
caretakers take great pains to protect their secrets.

Who are the caretakers? The Believers of the Source (also called the Godsmen) have taken it
upon themselves to administer to both the House and its inhabitants. They believe that the House
and the barmies they've selected to shelter are important to the Final Ascension. Remember, belief
has power in the planes, so the conviction of the faction shouldn't be taken lightly. As the Godsmen

3
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-3 -->

see it, the residents of the House are powers-in-the-mak-
ing, cutters and bloods almost ready to take the next step
up the staircase of existence. The Godsmen have taken it
upon themselves to care for them until the process fin-
ishes. Imagine the favors the faction might command
when one of their charges reaches the full state of power-
hood!

As far as anyone knows, such an event hasn't hap-
pened — yet. But all of the barmies residing in the House
do have a limited number of spell-like abilities that mark
them — in the Godsmen's minds, anyway — as powers-in-
the-making.

Harbinger House itself is described in detail in Chap-
ter Ill. The House is much larger on the inside than it ap-
pears to be from the outside; see the DM's screen for a par-
tial map of the interior. It's a house of secrets, a place of
mysteries hidden behind dark windows, a place as danger-
ous as it is alluring.

WHA+ HAS GONE BEFORE

Nari, a cunning succubus from the Abyss, has long sought
to rise above her lesser station and gain more influence in
tanar'ri society. But as she can’t hope to match the greater
tanar'ri in their endless games of war and destruction,
she’s tried to find an edge, something that'll give her the
power to compete with even the true tanar’ri. She believes
such an edge — if one exists at all — can be found in Sigil,
the City of Doors.

Nari arrived in the Cage some weeks ago. Deciding
her purpose would be better served if her true nature was
kept hidden, she took the form of a beautiful human fe-
male and began making the rounds of taverns, inns, and
guild halls, seeking something to aid her ambitions. It did-
n't take long for the rumors about Harbinger House to
reach her. The idea of a nexus of planar energy that’s a
miniature version of Sigil was a rumor too good to leave
unexplored. She used all the skills and talents at her dis-
posal to hook up with the custodian of the House, a Gods-
man named Old Favur.

After a few dalliances with the Godsman, Nari learned
enough of Harbinger House's secrets to know she wanted
to possess it. During their times together, Favur gladly pro-
vided her with information about the House and the people
it sheltered. The succubus was particularly interested in
two of the barmies: Sougad Lawshredder and Trolan of Ec-
stasy (now called simply Trolan the Mad).

A decade ago, Sougad carved a bloody path through
the Cage, murdering members of lawful factions in a ritu-

alistic fashion. Before the dabus or the Harmonium could
bring him down, the Godsmen captured Sougad and made
a place for him in Harbinger House. The faction believed
Sougad's innate abilities marked him as someone who'd
already transcended mere mortality, and that the murders
were part of an elaborate rite to bring him to full power-
hood.

Trolan, too, came to Sigil with a definite goal in mind:
to win the love of the Lady of Pain. He was devoted to her,
trying in vain to get her attention while others preferred to
avoid even her passing shadow. The dabus, enigmatic ser-
vants of the Lady that they are, brought Trolan to Harbin-
ger House and left him in the care of the Godsmen. Why he
wasn't flayed, quartered, or otherwise put in the dead-
book is unknown, but it was the very fact that Trolan had
expressed his adoration of the Lady and remained alive
that earned him a place in Harbinger House.

Nari wants to gain possession of the House by chang-
ing the hearts and minds of its inhabitants over to her way
of thinking. She’s heard whispers about towns on the Out-
lands that slid into other planes once the attitudes of the
residents shifted from neutrality to law or chaos, and she
believes she can do the same thing with Harbinger House.
She figures that once the place slides into the Abyss, it
won't take long for her to unlock its secrets.

(What Nari doesn't know is that the House won't slide
out of Sigil. Fact is, none of the Cage can be cast off except
by the power of the Lady of Pain. But the PCs probably
don't know that either, so they'll act to stop Nari's scheme.
After all, better safe than sorry.)

The plan was simple: Trolan would occupy the Lady
while Nari seduced Harbinger House into her corner.
Sougad, however, offered Neri something more. “No mat-
ter what you may think, Mistress of Chaos,” Sougad told
her from behind the locked door of his prison, “the Gods-
men are right. There is a way to step up the ladder of exis-
tence, to ascend from mortal to immortal. I've already
taken the first steps out of the realm of humanity and into
the plane of power. It has nothing to do with the tests the
Godsmen go on and on about. It has to do with this place
— with Harbinger House.”

To further his own ends, Sougad told Nari his plan for
becoming a power. He left out some details, but he pro-
vided enough so she saw the dark of it. “Since I've been
here, I've learned that you need two things to vitalize the
ritual,” Sougad confided. “The planarity and the focrur
control the House, and the House opens the conduits of
spiritual energy needed to achieve godhood. That was the
mistake | made the first time. | had the ritual, but I didn’t
have the energy to power it.”

Like most planars, Nari knew that powers were barred
from entering Sigil — the Lady of Pain somehow prevented
it. But what if a power were created in Sigil? Could even
the Lady stop such a transformation?

Nari charmed Old Favur, the custodian, into telling
her about the items Sougad had mentioned. “The planarity

e4
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-4 -->
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-5 -->

is a unique arti-
fact that never
leaves factol
Ambar's possession,” Old Favur
explained one night as the
candle beside his bed burned
low. “Its shape constantly
changes, and to look at it is to see the energy of the multi-
verse itself. What does it do? Why, it opens the doors, of
course. All the doors of Harbinger House.”

As for the focrux, Favur called it the heart of Harbin-
ger House. “It looks like a larger version of the planarity,”
he said, “but its connection to the energy of the multiverse
is much more powerful. If the planarity is the key, then the
focrux is the floodgate waiting to be opened. And we will
open it, when the Final Ascension is at hand.”

THE PLANARIF+Y
AND tHE FOCRUX

At rest, the planarity appears to be a nondescript sphere of
deep-blue stone, perfectly round and smooth, that fits in
the palm of a hand. However, when it comes within 50 feet
of a planar portal, the planarity reacts with excitement. It
changes shape, and a storm of energy rises up from its
depths to play along the inner surface of the stone. Spiky
protrusions emerge from the smooth surface, jutting as
much as three inches before plunging back into the stone.
These protrusions extend and retract faster and faster as
the planarity gets closer to a portal. At the same time, the
inner storm intensifies into a raging dance of color.

The planarity is a gate key, but not in the normal
sense. Unlike other gate keys, which are linked to specific
planar doors, the planarity has the power to open any por-
tal in Harbinger House. In addition, it’s the only key that
unlocks the sealed doors there (both mundane and planar).
The Godsmen’s factol keeps the planarity in his possession
at all times, sure that it'll play an important, if not pivotal,
role in the Final Ascension.

Anyone who holds the planarity can use it — that is,
anyone who knows the command word. A body’s just got
to place the item in his open palm, approach any planar
portal, and utter the right word. The planarity rises and
floats a few inches above the palm, and the portal opens.
The device doesn’t work if it’s in a pocket or pack, so acci-
dental trips aren't possible.

What's more, the planarity constantly records and
stores images and sounds from activities in its immediate
area. This feature was intended as a means to keep track of
which portals were opened, and when. Only the factol of
the Godsmen can call forth the full history of stored im-
ages, which “replay,” life size, in plain sight. How-
ever, if the PCs gain possession of the planarity,
they can summon images of the previous
few hours — an ability that might prove
important at the end of the adventure.

The focrux is a bigger version of the planarity —
about 15 feet in diameter. It stays inside Harbinger House
at all times, as the Godsmen believe it to be the spiritual
core of the House, a conduit for planar energies. All
strange properties of the House — such as the fact that it’s
bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside — are
powered by the focri-r. It also causes the exterior of the
House to reflect magic, preventing berks from harming the
place or sneaking inside. As with the planarity, the Gods-
men are certain that the focrur will prove to be critical to
the Final Ascension.

One property of the focrux that plays an important
role in the adventure is its ability to block all of Harbinger
House from scrying. No one — not even the Lady of Pain —
can peer inside while the focrur is operational. Fact is, the
focrux accounts for the uneasiness of the Lady (and,
through her, the dabus), as she can’t pinpoint the berk
who dares to tamper with portals and powers in the heart
of Sigil.

S®UGAD AND TROLAN

Sougad agreed to help Nari in exchange for his freedom.
She charged him to resume his murder spree, thus keeping
the lawful factions too busy to notice her actions. Sougad,
however, has his own agenda. He wants to finish his ascent
to powerhood by completing his ritual and using the pla-
narity and the focrux once Nari’s mastered the items.

Trolan, meanwhile, is to occupy the attention of the
Lady of Pain and her servants. By approaching Trolan in
the guise of the Lady herself, Nari has turned the barmy
into a prophet. In preaching his devotion to the Lady of
Pain, Trolan's natural charisma will convert others to his
cause, and, before long, his cult of Lady devotees (called
Those Who Court the Lady) will descend on the Cage to
break the Lady’s cardinal rule: no direct worship of Sigil’s
high-up. The chaos and mayhem will be exquisite!

Unfortunately for Nari, Old Favur retired before her
plan could be set in motion. A new custodian, Bereth, was
selected to oversee Harbinger House and its guests, an un-
foreseen event that forced the succubus to release Sougad
and Trolan earlier than she'd planned.

SUMMARY OF +HE
ADVEN+F+URE

The player characters (PCs) begin Harbinger House in
Sigil, engaged in some between-adventure activity. They
may be relaxing and enjoying the wonders of the City of
Doors, looking for work, or browsing
the Cage's shops in search of
bargains and rare planar items.
The adventure is designed so the
DM can involve the PCs in the story from
almost anywhere in the Cage.

<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-6 -->

In Chapter I, the PCs witness a number of strange oc-
Currences plaguing Sigil. They see dabus behaving in odd
Ways, meet members of a cult called Those Who Court the
Lady, and learn the facts and rumors Surrounding a series
of gruesome murders. This last chain of events — the slay-
ings of lawful sods throughout the Lower Ward and The
Lady's Ward — is the main focus and challenge of this
chapter. The PCs must find and try to Stop the killer,
Sougad Lawshredder, even if they
don't yet realize the dark of his
madness,

In Chapter II, the PCs
leave the Cage and head to
the Outlands, either follow-
ing Sougad after he es-
Caped or seeking the
leader of the Lady-
worshiping cult. In the
Sate-town of Ecstasy, the
PCs learn a bit more
about Trolan
and discover
that Sougad is
still killing Jawful
sods in a ritualistic fashion. A dra-
matic confrontation with Sougad leads
the PCs to believe — wrongly — that the barmy’s
been put in the dead-book once and for all. What's more,
the PCs find that Trolan’s rounding up more cultists in the
Sate-town of Curst and presumably head there to stop him.

Once in Curst, the party finds not one barmy who's
escaped from Harbinger House, but two — Trolan and Pas-

Cage. Pastor Browen, on the other hand, has been sent by
Nari to ambush the PCs, in case their meddling might ac-
tually disturb her plans. With the help of the Revolution-
ary League and the town’s Wall Watch, Browen plans to
stop the PCs when they come to find Trolan.

In Chapter III, the PCs return to Sigil to explore Har-
binger House, which seems to hold the key to the myster-
ies of the murders, the cult, and the dabus. The House has
been darkly changed as a result of being under Nari'’s con-
trol; the heroes must work their way through its madden-

of the House before she tries to ascend to the next level of
existence. Though the PCs don’t know it, Sougad still lives,
and he's getting ready to make an ascension himself.

Harbinger House. Copies of the PLANESCAPE Monstrous
Compenpium® Appendix, A Player's Primer to the Outlands,

necessary to play this adventure.

Harbinger House is designed for a party of four to six
player characters of 4th to 7th level. The Stoup shouldn't
be new to Sigil or the planes; in other words, don't use this
adventure as an introduction to the Setting. It works best

as part of an existing

PLANESCAPE campaign.

It's important to

keep in mind that a PLANESCAPE

adventure is more

about ideas than

monster-bashing. The

DM is encouraged to

award experience points

based on completing story

Soals (see Chapter 8 of the

DMG). The conclusion of

this adventure addresses

story-based awards for
Harbinger House.

Italicized text printed in amber is

problems,

The gatefold screen that accompanies the adventure
Provides both DM and player maps. The outside features
two full-color maps of sections of Sigil for the players to
use as their characters explore the streets and buildings
of the Cage. The inside features the same maps of Sigil,
Customized for the DM — these versions contain numbers
that mark the important sites likely to be visited by play-
ers. Note that these maps are close-ups of Sigil and con-
tain some details and street names not shown on the
overall map in In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil. (Because the
size of Sigil can change at the whim of the Lady of Pain,
the maps of the city blocks have no scales to indicate
exact distances.) The inside of the screen also contains a
partial map of the gate-town of Ecstasy, and a map of the
rooms in Harbinger House that the PCs must explore.

In Harbinger House, the PCs Tun into several different
types of tanar’ri. Most tanar'ri have a gate ability that lets
them summon other fiends; however, gate abilities aren't
listed in the tanar'ri Statistics provided in this adventure,
The only place the PCs'll run into tanar'rj is in Sigil, and
the Cage can't be entered by a gate spell.

Finally, the DM is encouraged to read the entire ad-
venture before attempting to run it.

FACTIONS
IN HIS ADVENTURE

Factions always play some part in a PLANESCAPE adven-
ture, as most PCs belong to one philosophical fraternity
or another. Because so much of this adventure re-
volves around Harbinger House, the Believers of
the Source have a vested interest in the unfold-
ing events. Their general reaction to the
events of the story — along with that

of the other factions — is outlined
below.

THE AtHAR

The Athar don’t believe the chant about Harbinger House
for a minute. A place full of barmy powers-in-the-making?
Ha! A place full of barmy liars is more like it! The myster-
ies presented in the adventure attract the attention of the
Lost, however. As the Defiers love to discover the secret be-
hind everything and long to look upon the face of the un-
knowable, mysteries concerning the Lady of Pain, the
dabus, and Sigil itself certainly spark the Athar's interest.
‘Course, the faction’s most concerned about the murder
spree. Two \awful members of the Athar were victims of the
murderer, and factol Terrance calls for a quick solution.

BELIEVERS OF +HE SOURCE

The Believers of the Source have a natural connection to
the events in this adventure. Harbinger House is a holding
of the Godsmen, staffed by Godsmen, and supported by
Godsmen funds. A problem that threatens the House and
the Cage around it definitely concerns the faction.

The Believers of the Source know that something of
great importance is occurring in the shadow of Harbinger
House. Faction officials could hire the PCs to look into
matters, capture the escaped barmies (quietly and without
fuss, of course), OF recover the planarity after it’s stolen
from factol Ambar in Chapter I. However, the Godsmen try
their best not to have the faction publicly connected to the
bad events plaguing Sigil. The faction wants to end
Sougad's threat quickly, without letting too much informa-
tion leak out. As for Trolan, if the Godsmen can't contain
him, they'll do their best to claim he was never under their
care. Other factions — especially those that consider the
Godsmen to be their enemies, like the Bleak Cabal and the
Dustmen — would love to get their hands on proof that the
Godsmen messed up.

THE BLEAK CABAL

The Bleak Cabal is especially interested in finding infor-
mation that paints the Believers of the Source in a poor
light. While blame for all of the trouble that revolves
around Harbinger House falls on Nari’s shoulders, a

Bleaker could make a healthy case to at least
discredit the Godsmen and gain favor in his
own faction.

THE D@@MGUARD

The Doomguard are quite interested in finding the

murderer and putting a stop to the bloodshed.

After all, lawful members of this faction are as

likely to be targeted by Sougad as other lawfuls. If a

member of the PC group belongs to the faction, he or

she might be approached by the faction leaders to look

into the ongoing murders before a Doomguard cutter ends
up in the dead-book.

THE DUS+MEN

The law-killer obviously has no respect OF appreciation
for Death, though he is desperately trying to impress it
with his bloody antics. All Sougad’s accomplishing is to
force his victims to go through the whole process again —
and that's something no Dustman-in-good-standing can
tolerate. Trolan, on the other hand, at least shows style
and loving devotion in his mad rush toward Death's warm
embrace.

The faction leadership watches to make sure the mur-
ders don't spread to the Hive or otherwise impinge on the
Dustmen’s areas of interest, and they make an effort to
collect the victims for the Mortuary, but they otherwise
stay out of the proceedings.

THE FATED

The Fated see the actions of both Sougad and Trolan as
signs of weakness and cowardice: Both seek to gain re-
spect of a sort without properly earning it. What's more,
the utter evil of Nari’s scheme should perturb all but the
most evil of the Fated.

The faction leadership keeps a close eye on the mur-
ders of the members of the other factions, but refuses to
get involved in matters that don't directly concern the
Fated. The factol, Duke Rowan Darkwood, won't order his
members to act unless a reward of some sort is involved.
Anything less would be considered charity, and the Fated
don’t perform acts of charity for any reason.

THE FRAFERNIFY @F ORDER

The breakdown of law definitely disturbs the Fraternity of
Order. Flagrant criminal acts, total disregard for the law,
wanton acts of violence — it's enough to make a Guvner
go barmy! Beyond the obviously evil acts of Sougad and
the leatherheaded actions of Trolan. the thought of the
dabus losing their ordered approach to city maintenance
causes great distress in the hearts and minds of Guvners
everywhere.

As a group, the Free League won't Set involved; however,
any PCs who are members of this faction might choose to
throw in with whichever side seems to offer the best re-
wards,

THE HARMO@NIUM

As for Sougad, some Anarchists see him as the harbinger
of the True Revolution and revel in the chaos and fear he's
inspired. Other members of the faction See him as a wild
card who could doom the Revolution before it has a
chance to move into full swing. The law-killer’s methods
are too extreme, they say, and the League has to keep itself
dark from the factions that would destroy it,

Harbinger House, however, appears to be nothing
more than a glorified indoctrination camp. A true victory
for the Revolution would be to discover what's happening
in the House, and then set the prisoners free.

THE XA@SIFECHS

The chaos that swirls around Harbinger House cushions
Xaositects in soothing, wonderful havoc. True, murdering
those who subscribe to law is a little extreme, and seeking
out the Lady of Pain when the end result is always death
may be a bit barmy, but isn't the chaos of the situation beau-
tiful? And the chant is that the inside of Harbinger House is
even more chaotic than anywhere else in Sigil — including
the Hive! Who cares if it's dangerous? There are some mys-
teries worth solving, some randomness that must be seen
firsthand to be totally appreciated.

factol Karan shows more than a passing interest in
these events. The murders concern him primarily because a
significant number of important berks from other factions
have started to point fingers at the Xaositects. Perhaps a
Chaosman PC could look into matters for him.

THACO 15; #AT 2; Dmg 143/143 (fists); AC -3 (ring of pro-
tection +3); HD 6; hp 32; MV 12, Fl 18 (C); SA energy
drain; SD +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire,
electricity, and poison; half damage from cold and gas;
never surprised; MR 30%; SZ M (6 fect tall); Int excep-

Spell-like abilities (usable at will once per round); charm
person, clairaudience, darkness 15’ radius, ESP, become
ethereal (as if using oil of etherealness), infravision, plane
shift, shapechange, suggestion, and teleport without error.

Nari’s always been a dreamer, seeking a better life, a
higher station, and a more prominent position in tanar'ti
society. However, getting these things requires more power
than is normally available to a lesser tanar'ti. So Nari's
hatched a plan worthy of a balor, one that won't just give
her power — one that she thinks'll make her a power.

The succubus isn't a fighter. She uses guile, charm,
and seduction to get what she wants, “borrowing” weak-
willed males when she needs brawn for a particular task.
Nari spends most of her time in Sigil in the form of a beau-
tiful human female. In addition to her ring of protection
+3, Nari wears a necklace of missiles, which possesses nine
fireball missiles: one 10-dice, two 8-dice, two 6-dice, and
four 4-dice fireballs. If severely pressed, Nari can call upon
her associate, Crimjak the marquis cambion.

Sougad Lawshredder lived up to his name during a murder
spree he conducted almost a decade ago. For seven days,
Sougad held Sigil in a grip of terror, and few who lived
through that week could ever forget it.

The Godsmen eventually captured Sougad and locked
him away in Harbinger House — much to the complaint of
the Mercykillers, The Godsmen felt that Sougad’s murder-
ous tendencies would disappear as he ascended toward
powerhood. The fact that he’s shown remarkably little im-
provement over the last 10 years has caused factol Ambar
some concern; now that Sougad’s escaped, that concern
has become genuine fear.

he also has ge-

gence and can present
himself as a distinguished, witty gentleman. However, his
calm moods never last, and Sougad shifts into maniacal-
killer mode without any warning. Naturally, he loves to
frighten his victims before he kills them.

Nari believes that Sougad will help her become a
power, but the murderer has his own agenda. A decade
ago, he came close to completing an arcane ritual for as-
cending to a new level of existence. Now, by combining
the ritual with the power of the planarity and the focrux,
Sougad believes that godhood will finally be his.
