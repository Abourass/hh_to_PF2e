A SUCCUBUS WI+H AN UNQUENCHABLE LUS+ FOR POWER
IS FURNING +HE CAGE IN+@ A RIPPING MADHOUSE.
AND +HE LADY @F PAIN AIN’+ PLEASED....

Something's foul in Sigil, berk. A mad slasher prowls the streets, leaving a trail of bloody clues in his wake.
Leatherheads boldly court the Lady of Pain, longing for the sharp touch of her shadow. Even the silent
dabus're acting barmy, a sure sign that the Lady herself is uneasy. Are these strange events tied to a mad-
house full of spell-touched sods ready to slip the bonds of mortality? A curious body'd better step carefully.
After all, the dead-book's full of fools who wished for power — or got in the way of another berk's wish.

Harbinger House is a PLANESCAPE adventure for four to six characters of 4th to 7th levels. From Sigil
to the Outlands and back again, the heroes must piece together a puzzle that could shake the Cage
to its foundations. A dark secret of the multiverse waits to be discovered in the lunatic asylum called
Harbinger House, and only the player characters can shape its power — for good or ill.

The PLANescape Campaign Setting boxed set is required to run this adventure. The PLANESCAPE
Monstrous Compenpium® Appendix, In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil, and A Player’s Primer to the
Outlands are recommended to enhance your enjoyment of this adventure.
