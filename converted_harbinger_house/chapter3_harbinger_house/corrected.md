* Getting Yurel Zarnthaskar (Pr/é human/F 10/
Fated/LN), the commander of the Wall Watch, to
assist them. The PCs can accomplish this in a
number of ways. Threats that Trolan’s continued
presence'll bring a visit from the Lady of Pain
scare Zarnthaskar into letting the group out.
Promises to lend future aid to Zarnthaskar —
who's itching to return to his prime-material
homeworld and seek revenge against his enemies
— also win his assistance.

against Qarz and his bashers, possibly by inciting
them to rise up against the “evil” guards who'd try
to keep “noble, free-thinking cutters” imprisoned
against their will. However, Baox and his group
won't fight unless the PCs battle at their side.

other group of cutters when they try to leave —
cutters who can prove they've got somewhere to
go and a means of getting there. The DM must de-

Wall Watch to open the gate.

BROWEN’'S LAS+ StAND

Pastor Browen surreptitiously watches the PCs as they try
to escape from Curst. If it seems like they're going to get
past the Wall Watch, Browen emerges from his hiding
place and attacks with full fury, intending to kill as many

PCs as he can. The time for subtlety is past. His mission is
to delay the adventurers in Curst as long as possible, and
he figures that forever would be a good length of time.

As he attacks, the barmy — in his rage — inadvertently
reveals more about his mission than he'd planned. Fact is,
his rantings are clues to the PCs that something darker is
behind the attack:

“No! You'll not return yet! She's not ready! Those
cultists must die! She needs the blood! The blood! Open the
doors! Open all the doors!"

Browen becomes more and more incoherent as he
continues to yell. The PCs might misinterpret his ravings to
mean that the mysterious “she” literally needs the blood of
the cultists, missing the point that the poor sods are just a
distraction to cloak her true activities.

If the PCs bind and question Browen, he reveals a
good deal more about Nari, screaming that he must return
to the House to help her take it into the Abyss. However, he
knows nothing about Nari's bid to become a power.

DM Nott: Pastor Browen worships an unnamed god of
evil who he refers to as “the Mad One.” The barmy priest
believes that the best way to convert a sod is to bash his
head in; if the sod dies, Browen's power gets a new spirit to
use in the cause of insanity.

The Godsmen marked Browen as a power-in-the-
making due to his innate abilities to exercise limited con-
trol over the loca] weather. Without using arcane words,
magical gestures, or strange components, Browen can call
forth a wall of fog, direct a gust of wind, or summon an ice
storm (as per the spells of the same names). He uses these
abilities as his own madness moves him, but always with
great showmanship and a sermon of insanity.

BACK +@ +HE CAGE

Once free of Curst, the PCs can follow the road back to Ec-
stasy and take the gate in the garden back to Sigil. If they
didn't take the gate key (the wooden triangle) from the
dead body in the razorvine outside of Curst, the DM can
have a friendly sod in Ecstasy provide them with a key —
that is, when he gets around to it. Remember, folks in Ec-
stasy don't like to rush.

The DM can also provide the PCs with a gate on the
Outlands a bit closer to Curst.

With Trolan the Beloved (or Mad, depending sh
on a body's perspective) in hand, the PCs
return to Sigil and search out
the mysterious place called
Harbinger House. They have a limited amount of time

played on poor Trolan.

For his part, Trolan firmly

believes that the Lady of Pain spoke to him
He won't tell his followers to stay away unless

the PCs can prove that someone has

tricked him. To do

that, the PCs

have to find

Nari the
succubus,

The PCs must
explore a portion of
the House and deal with a
number of its special inhabitants before finally confronting Nari and learn-
ing the details of her twofold plot. First, she wants to convince the residents
ot Harbinger House that chaotic evil is the best belief system for their hearts
and souls, thereby causing the House to slip into the Abyss. On that plane,
Nari can study its secrets at her leisure. Indeed, the PCs find chaotic evil ten
dencies in many of the barmies in the House,

The second part of Nari’s plot centers around her version of Sougad’s

murderous ritual. With a specially prepared long sword, the suc-
cubus plans to slay 13 lawful sods in the presence of the planarity
and the focrwr, thus — she hopes — transforming her into a power.
But when the PCs reach Nari, the situation grows more compli
cated with the arrival of Crimjak and a number of manes from the
Abyss. What's more, Sougad Lawshredder himself returns,

Harbinger House won't actually slide

ever, Nari doesn’t know either of these things and plans on
seeing each goal through to the end.
The PCs should believe that Sougad died in
Chapter Il; however, the barmy made it back to Sigil
and went directly to Harbinger House. By the time the
PCs reach the House, Sougad’s already killed two more lawful sods
within. Clues scattered throughout may alert the PCs to Sougad’s pres-
ence, but they won't run into him until the final scene.

The map of Harbinger House, printed on the DM's side of the
gatefold screen, depicts only a small portion of this immense mansion. The
true scope of a place that’s larger on the inside than it is on the outside can't
be adequately detailed in the course of this adventure. However, the DM
should feel free to add more rooms as desired to expand the PCs’ exploration
of the House.

RE+URNIN(

+ iG!
rr & :

Whoever the PCs agreed to help at the start of Chap-
ter IT comes looking for them the moment they step
through the portal back to Sigil. If they decided to go
after Trolan on their own (or followed Sougad to the
Outlands and then got involved with the cult), Narcovi
tracks them down. She still has questions, and as long as the dabus continue to
act strangely, she'll keep digging. It’s her belief that the dabus’ behavior is somehow
connected to the murders, so in her mind the case won't be solved until the dabus return
to normal,

Other possibilities: Kariana wants to know if they've found her brother Kedd; Fac-
tol Ambar wants to know if they've found Trolan and Sougad; and other fac-
tion leaders want to know what's been happening on the Outlands and
when they can expect more cultists to arrive.

If the PCs can't locate Harbinger House on their own, they can ask
factol Ambar for directions; he'll be at the Great Foundry, the headquarters
of the Godsmen. Ambar thanks the PCs for returning Trolan and asks them to take the
barmy back to the House. Ambar admits
casually.

Ambar also seems disturbed that he still hasn't recovered the missing planarity (stolen for Nari
in Chapter 1). [f the PCs question him about it, the factol divulges a bit more about the item than he
had in the past, confessing that the planarity opens portals and records images of surrounding events
for later historical study. He asks the PCs to keep an eye out for it when they return Trolan to the
House.

If Trolan was killed in Curst, factol Ambar simply hires the PCs to locate the
missing planarity, suggesting that its magical energies are so closely tied to Harbinger House that the
House is the best place to begin the search. (No factol in the history of the Godsmen has ever lost the
planarity. To prevent the theft from being made public and weakening his position as factol, Ambar
must employ “outside” cutters — the PCs — to do the leg work.)

If the PCs seem reluctant to visit Harbinger House at all, the DM can have several dabus — act-
ing more strangely than ever — follow them around the streets of the Cage. The dabus communicate
their tension and fear by forming picture-symbols of the area around the House, which should en-
courage even the most hesitant PCs to check the location out.

The trip through Sigil’s streets to Harbinger House reveals that the dabus continue to display un-
characteristic behavior. They're still cleaning “dirt” from spotless cobblestones, painting freshly
painted walls, and trimming razorvine to the very roots. The closer the group gets to Harbinger
House, the more dabus they see hard at work. During the trip, one dabus turns to gaze upon the PCs
and Trolan. Read:

The symbol is the icon of the Abyss. The dabus, and perhaps through him the Lady of Pain, is
providing a warning to the PCs as to the nature of the true enemy. In a way, this is also a call for
help, as the dabus haven't been able to trace their nervousness to its source (due to the scrying shield
generated by the focru.s).
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-04 -->

When the PCs reach the dead-end street where Har-
binger House resides, they immediately notice something
odd: There are no dabus working on the street. In fact,
there's almost no one around. The nearby hovels appear
tightly locked or deserted. No street beggars or merchants
are evident. Compared to the hustle and bustle on the sur-
rounding streets, the deathly silence and stillness of this
street should be particularly jarring to the PCs. Read:

The street you were directed to is set off from the rest
of Sigil by a spiky wall of stone and razorvine, Once voy
pass through the gate formed by the arching walls, You no-
fice an immediate difference from the other Sstreers you
walked down. There aren't any people here, or dabus, or
Shouting merchants, or arguing faction members, It’s quict,
deserted, and terribly dark Shadows fill every corner, The
walls and fhe caning hovels block much of Sigil's dim
light. [t's hard to imagine that a huge mansion sits among
these decrepit structures Then you see it, and everything
you imagined is swept away

Harbinger House fills the end of the street, climbing
above the high walls that surround three sides of its mas
sive structure. It's a place of insanity, for no clear-headed
architect desiqned this jumble of towers, levels, and wings.
Its oddly tilted walls, weirdly slanted roofs, and uneven
windows make ir almost painful to look ar. There are
doors, arches, and staircases everywhere, covering Surfaces
that should instead be car ered by shingles ar tiles or paint.

As your eyes roam across its door-covered walls or try
To fotlow a staircase that winds to nowhere, you notice a
remarkable thing. The House was built without using a
smigie right angle, Instead every corner forms an acute or
making walls Jul toward you or tilt away
from you at varying degrees

All is quiet. Even the windows are dark, but you sense
that someone for something) is staring down at you. Then
the door at tire ‘op of the porch su ings open, beckoning

oofuse angle

VOu inside

If the PCs view the opening door as a trap, they might
try to search out a different entrance. All the other doors
and windows are locked, however, and won't open for
brawny bashers or even knock spells. Fact is, the focrux
Causes the House to reflect spells, effectively barring
bloods from teleporting, phasing, or otherwise
gaining magical access to the place.

The only way in is through the
front door.

WHA+ ABOU+ TR®LAN?

Trolan travels with the PCs as they explore the House, ac-
companying them either because he followed them from
Curst or because the PCs brought him there at factol Am-
bar's request. However, unless the danger is extremely
rave, Trolan won't raise his Sword against the House's
residents. With the exception of Sougad, he considers them
all to be his friends.

Trolan can, of course, give the PCs information about
some of the residents. He knows nothing about Galkin,
Kaydi, or Teela, but if the PCs need help with any of the
other barmies, Trolan can pass along a hint or two. How-
ever, he doesn’t know where the doors lead, as he was
never allowed to wander on his own.

By the time the Sroup enters the House, Trolan's nat-
ural healing ability has restored him to his maximum hit
points. He can also heal some of the PCs’ wounds by tak-
ing them into Area 4A, where the focrur used to be kept
(see page 50 for details),

SLIPPING THE BuNDs: If Trolan was killed in Curst, the
PCs must navigate their way through the House without
the tiefling’s advice or healing touch.

EXPL@®RING +HE H®USE

Nari‘s been cooking up a welcome for the PCs ever since
she spotted them in Bloodgem Park. She knew they'd even-
tually track her to Harbinger House, and it doesn't take
long for word to reach her of their return to Sigil. With the
Stolen planarity, Nari's gained control of a portion of the
House and the barmies residing therein. Between the
barmies and the doors she's left open, she believes the
PCs'll be kept busy — if not killed outright — until she be-
Comes a power or the House slides into the Abyss.

Tite pooks: All the doors indicated as locked on the
map on the gatefold screen can't be opened by any means
except the planarity. But even if the PCs find the planarity,
they can't use it to Open any doors in the House. Neither
factol Ambar nor Nari will divulge the command word
needed to use the item.

As indicated on the map, some of the doors open di-

rectly onto other planes. If any PCs open such a
door, the DM can have them pulled
onto those planes, or allow them to

teeter on the brink before being
pulled back into the House by quick
companions.

THe wivpows: A number of windows in Harbinger
House are actually portals that lead to — and look out upon
— other planes. Whereas normal portals never show their
destination, the magic of Harbinger House allows a body to
look through one of the windows and see where he'll end
up. However, taking a side trip could result in the PCs ar-
riving too late to stop Nari or Sougad. Trolan should urge

418+
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-05 -->

the PCs not to get too close to the windows, as they proba-
bly don’t have keys for returning. If the PCs insist on using
the windows, the DM can do as he pleases — let them ex-
plore, drive them back to the House before the portal closes,
or even send them on a completely different adventure.

THE RESIDENTS: The more prominent barmies of the
House have names and full statistics, as detailed through-
out this chapter. Nari’s given some of them magical items
so they have a better chance to delay and perhaps even kill
the PCs.

However, the House also contains various other be-
ings, including Godsman caretakers who've been charmed
or imprisoned by Nari, less powerful barmies, and dretches
brought from the Abyss to guard Nari and her plans. If the
PCs battle any of these other residents, the DM may use the
following statistics or invent specific details for each, as
desired:

AVERAGE BARMY (Pt/VAR VAR/F2/—/Vak):

THE ROOMS OF
HARBINGER HOUSE

1. THE Porctt

A series of wooden steps lead up to a slightly elevated,
open-air porch. This is the main entrance used by the
Godsmen who care for the House and its inhabitants, and
the only one currently available to the PCs. Two wooden
pillars hold up the roof. and large bay windows frame each
side of the plain front door.

2. Tuk ENTRANCE HAUL

The front door leads into a large entrance hall. A thick rug
decorated with the icon of the Believers of the Source cov-
ers the floor, and various couches and chairs are set com-
fortably around the room. Two massive fireplaces cover
much of the far wall, cheery fires burning brightly in each.
A single door in each wall leads deeper into the House.
When the PCs enter this room, read:

49 

Al first glance there's no one to greet you, but then
you hear the squcak of a rocking chair. A rocker by the
fireplace on the right teeters at a rapid pace, its back to-
ward you to hide its occupant.

If the PCs approach the
rocker, they can see who's sitting
there. Read:

A young man sits in the rocker, wrapped tightly in a
thick blanket and shivering though the nearby fire blazes
hotly. He stares blankly into the flames, mouthing words in
a whisper almost too low to hear. If you strain, you can
pick up his chant, which he repeats over and aver again.
“Chaos dance and chaos burn, the Abyss is that for which
! vearn.”

This is one of the Godsmen (P1/d human/0/Believers
of the Source/LN) who helped care for Harbinger House, as
the badge he wears on his tunic indicates (though it’s cur-
rently hidden by the blanket). Nari has broken the faction
members, turning them into even bigger barmies than the
addle-coves they used to administer to. Those whose
minds collapsed have been given easy chants to sing until
the House slides over to the Abyss. If they can't actually
join Nari, at least they'll pay lip service to the doctrine of
her home plane.

3. Gansmen CeLIs

The Godsmen who work at Harbinger House use these
small cells as living quarters. Each one contains a bed, a
small table, a chair, and a storage chest. Various belong-
ings are still packed away, including spare clothes, weap-
ons (a short sword and dagger in each chest), and a small
amount of jink (10d4 gp each). None of the items are mag-
ical, though there is ample evidence that the people who
occupy these rooms belong to the Believers of the Source
(faction symbols are sewn into or otherwise adorn every-
thing).

Two cells hold things of interest to the PCs. The cell
marked “3A” on the map contains a dead body, the
eleventh victim of Sougad. The poor sod was a male Gods-
man, his face twisted into a terrified grimace and his body
covered by I! deep slashes made by a large blade. There's
a parchment note, three nutshells, and a discarded vrock
feather here as well.

The cell marked “3B” is the only one currently occu-
pied by a living body. A matronly female (Pl/? elf/0/Be-
lievers of the Source/CG) lies curled in a ball atop the bed.
Her mind has been shattered by Nari’s attempts to win her
over, and now only the barest hint of the woman she was
remains. She doesn't respond to anything the PCs say or
do; she just lies there with her eyes closed tight and her
thumb in her mouth. It'll take a lot of time and effort to
help this woman return to normal — something the PCs
can't afford at the moment.
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-06 -->

Bereth, the newest custodian to serve at Harbinger House,
uses the larger room as an office and the smaller room be-
yond the door as her living quarters. Windows in the office
provide a view of the street outside Harbinger House.

The office contains a large desk, a couch, a number of
chairs, and a bookcase full of scrolls and books (though
many of the texts now cover the floor). This area is a mess.
The desk has been overturned and emptied. The items on
the shelves have been tossed about. Someone was obvi-
ously looking for something, but there's no way to tell if it
was found or not.

If the PCs spend time looking through the mess, they
can find a few clues that might help them. One is the cus-
todian’s journal. The beginning of the journal features en-
tries made by Old Favur, the custodian before Bereth, His
entries end about four weeks ago, though quite a number
of pages have been tom out after that. The very last page
written by Favur talks about a young woman he met at

The Ascension: “Nari's a beautiful woman with dark hav
and faughing eyes. She makes me feel atpiost as Voung as
she is! We talked for hours, and she promised to meet me

fomorrow nmigit wre
ends there.

The journal picks up after the ripped-out pages with
the first entries made by Bereth. There are a week's worth
of these, dealing with normal House business. But one
entry, dated three days ago, may intrigue the PCs. It reads:

4A.M

When the PCs enter the custodian’s living quarters, Trolan

locates and opens the secret door (marked on the map) and

takes them through to a small, square, empty room. “J/tis ts

where the focrux used to be,~ he says. “I always spent hours

meditating in here, calmed by its soothing energies.”
All Trolan can tell the PCs about the focrir is

that the Godsmen called it “the heart of

the House” and that it was

said to prevent

outsiders

from looking inside. However, residual energies left in this
chamber by the focrux bring Trolan’s natural healing abil-
ity to the fore. If allowed a few moments to meditate,
Trolan gains the power to deliver a healing touch to the
PCs. The PCs who've been kind to Trolan up to this point
in the adventure receive the equivalent of cure serious
wounds — Trolan’s touch restores 2d8+1 lost hit points.
The PCs who've been neutral or nasty to Trolan receive the
equivalent of cure light wounds, regaining 1d8 lost hit
points.

The act of healing others tires Trolan; it only works
while in the meditation chamber and only works once for
each PC. Repeatedly leaving and re-entering the chamber
will nor grant Trolan additional healing power.

Sueeie tt Bunos: If Trolan isn't with the PCs when
they enter the custodian’s living quarters (for example, if
he was killed in Curst), they can’t gain any healing benefits
from the meditation chamber. They may still find the se-
cret door, but only Trolan can gain the power to heal by
meditating within.

5, STORAGE

This long, narrow storage room contains blankets and
extra bedding, table cloths, nondescript clothing, and
boxes full of wooden bowls. These are for the residents
being cared for in the House. Windows high on the far wall
are sealed up with stout boards. If the PCs remove the
boards, they find that the windows look out not on Sigil
but on the Elemental Plane of Water.

A secret panel on the wall behind the blankets (which
can be found if the PCs successfully search for a secret
door) hides a small alcove. The alcove contains two po-
tions of healing, one potion of extra healing, an elixir of
health, and an elixir of madness. The elixir of health can
be used to cure one of the barmies in the House, or any PC
who drinks the elixir of madness. However, it does not heal
wounds or restore lost hit points. Any barmy cured with
the elixir loses his innate powers.

6. GODSMEN’S KITCHEN
This kitchen provides meals for the faction members who
live in the House while caring for the resident barmies.
Windows in this room have been boarded up, though the
boards have been removed from the window on the left
side of the door. Light from Krigala, the first layer of the
Beastlands, spills into the kitchen through the uncovered
window. If the PCs look out, a lion wanders over and
looks in.
A wide variety of ingredients cover the great table
here, and all five huge kettles are boiling over with some
strange-smelling dishes. Two Godsmen, one male
and one female, scramble from pot to pot,
adding a touch of this or a dash of that,
stirring the boiling mixtures, or just
taking satisfied whilTs of the
contents.
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-07 -->

These Godsmen have been driven to insanity by Nari’s
seductive urgings. She's made them chaotic evil through
her subtle manipulations, which becomes evident if the
PCs linger in the kitchen. Read:

The man wears a loincloth and an apron as he moves
from steaming pot to boiling kettle, tossing ingredients into
cach pot from a basket he carries. There doesn’t seem to be
a pattern to his recipe, and his ingredients don't look very
appetizing — a handful of worms, a pinch of insect shells,
a dash of sharp glass. “For the celebration,” he whispers
when he sees you. “We're moving today and Nari wants to
have a party!”

The woman wears a sack that’s
heen altered to serve as a long tunic,
gathered at her waist with a length of
razorvine. Her knee-high leather boots
are spattered with dark, wet stains,
and she wears a necklace with the
Godsmen’s icon as a bandanna
around her head. She dances from
pot to pot, sniffing the aromas.

“Have you come for din-
ner?” she asks. “Or
maybe you are din-

ner. | think you're

just what we need for
this dish.” With that, she pulls a
long dagger from behind her back
and smiles wickedly.

These barmies aren't responsible for their
actions. They were both respectable Godsmen before Nari
began working her charms on them. The PCs’ best bet is to
leave the room. The barmies won't follow the PCs, as they
must stay with their chaotic stews. If the PCs linger in the
kitchen, both Godsmen attempt to add them to the stews.

7. Goosmen’s Dintnc HAL

This large chamber is the Godsmen's dining hall. All of the
Godsmen working in Harbinger House take their daily
meals here. Two massive fireplaces cover most of the side
walls, and four large round tables are set in the center of
the room. A number of comfortable chairs sit facing the
fireplace on the left side of the hall.

Aztral of the Many Faces has been given this room to
defend by Nari, the new mistress of the House. Originally,
he had a neutral outlook on the multiverse; thanks to Nari,
that’s now shifted to chaotic evil.

Aztral is schizophrenic, and like all of the barmies in
Harbinger House, he has a few unique abilities that mark
him as a power-in-the-making. Among these abilities is
the power to change personalities and alignments as often
as a Xaositect changes his mind. This talent revolves
around his affliction. Aztral mimics the personalities of
those around him, shifting to their way of speaking, walk-

ing, and thinking, and even gaining the best of their tal-
ents through magical absorption. Since the change
wrought by Nari, Aztral's personality becomes a chaotic
evil version of the character he emulates. To the PC, it's
like looking into a twisted mirror and seeing his or her
own dark reflection.

The targets of Aztral’s absorption get a saving throw
vs. petrification. A successful throw indicates that Aztral
was unable to absorb the target's abilities; a failed throw
means that the barmy succeeded.

Once Aztral absorbs a PC's personality and talents, he

gains that character's natural prop-

erties — hit points, physical at-
tributes, combat skills, and
any special abilities (such
as memorized spells).

Whatever weapon

I'M GING +@ BE YOU. Aztral fights with
AND +HERE’S — currently, a

large, wooden

spoon — behaves just

like the absorbed character's

weapon, including damage

amounts and enchantment

bonuses. Aztral can hold on

to a character's talents for

1d6 rounds. At the end of

that period, he must absorb someone

else's talents or revert to his own
statistics.

When the PCs enter

this room, Aztral picks the

most powerful-looking one to

absorb first. Read:

A lone figure sits in a large, comfartable-looking chair
in this dining hail. He's @ human male with short-cropped
black hair, silver eyes, and a plain white tunic over black
pants. He waves a long wooden spoon and smiles ar you.
“Welcome to the domain of Aztral,” he exclaims, leaping

from his chair. “These chairs, those tables, the fireplaces!

Everything you see is mine!”

He steps toward you, and for a moment his whole
body turns silvery, like the surface of a mirror. You see
your own reflection in his silvery form, and then the effect
is gone. “Well,” Aztral says gleefully, “now that I'm you,
there can only be one of me!” With that, he swings bis
wooden spoon at you, its glowing head suddenly looking
very dangerous.

During the encounter, Aztral keeps asking the PCs if
any of them have a lawful outlook on life. “Are you law-

ful? You look like a lawful sod. You should head right up

to the party. There's a place at Nari’s table for lawful sods
like you.” He doesn’t provide any further information
about the party or Nari.

8. HALL oF Doors

This long. narrow hall contains many doors. While there's
only one door on the wall the PCs enter through, the other
walls are covered with them. There are a total of eight
doors at ground level: the walls extend 50 feet to the ceil-
ing, and every 10 feet up is another row of doors. If the
PCs have some way of reaching the higher doors, they find
that all of them are locked. Only the eight doors at ground
level can be opened.

Each ground-level door has a letter assigned to it on
the map on the gatefold screen. These doors lead to the
corresponding letter shown elsewhere on the map. For ex-
ample, if the PCs open the door marked “D,” they find
themselves looking out onto the Ethereal Plane.

If any of the PCs make a successful Wisdom check at
-2, they notice a small creature wriggling on the floor be-
tween doors “E” and “F” — an Abyssal leech. Sougad
dropped it from the pouch on his belt as he was heading
toward Nari's chamber.

9. THE ENGLESS STAIRS

The door marked “B” leads to a spiral staircase that de-
scends and ascends as far as the PCs can see. If they climb
in either direction, the stairs just keep going. The PCs can
wander forever on these stairs, and that's just what Nari
hopes will happen. The door can't be seen from the inside,
as it blends into the wall and becomes a secret portal. To
find it again, the PCs have to search for it. This takes time
(10 minutes for every 10-foot section of stairs) and re-
quires a successful roll for finding secret doors. The DM
must decide how far from the door the PCs wander before
they try to exit back into the hall.

10. Tower of Winoows

The door marked “I” opens into a tower room. A free-
standing spiral staircase in the middle of the room climbs
to a height of 30 feet and stops just beneath the ceiling. It
doesn't lead to another level; it just stands alone in the
center of the room.

Windows of varying widths cover the walls, stretch-
ing from the floor to the ceiling. Each window looks into
a different prime-material world in the multiverse. One
shows the crowded streets of Waterdeep, another looks

out upon the sandy wastes of Athas, a third displays the
majestic towers of a castle in Karameikos, and so on.
Some show portions of Krynn, Greyhawk, an island chain
where dragons rule over elves and dwarves, and other
places so strange that the PCs barely recognize what
they're seeing.

These windows aren't portals; the PCs can't step
through one and wind up, for example, in Waterdeep.
They're just reflections of what the barmy who resides in
this tower sees all the time. Galkin Farseer sees all of the
varied worlds of the multiverse at once, and the views
have driven him mad. He sees these images wherever he
looks, even when he closes his eyes. Sleep doesn't provide
a respite, as the images follow him into his dreams. The
windows, however, help separate the images and focus his
thoughts. He’s learned to transfer a single image to a sin-
gle window, thus clearing away some of the jumble that's
always with him.

When the PCs arrive, they don't notice Galkin at first.
He's sitting on the stairs, about halfway up, staring at the
images of Waterdeep scrolling behind one of the windows.
Galkin hates to be disturbed, and the constant barrage of
landscapes and societies that assault his senses give him a
very bad temper. He also has a few powers available to
make his temper dangerous. Galkin is what the Godsmen
call “spell-touched.” He embodies the living essence of one
particular spell: lightning bolt. This doesn’t give him the
ability to cast a bolt from his fingertips; he actually be-
comes the bolt of lightning, cascading around the room
and causing damage to whoever he touches.

Galkin can become a lightning bolt at will, but he
must make a successful Constitution check to actually
transform. His energy form lasts for one action in a partic-
ular round and gives him all the attributes of a lightning
bolt spell. In other words, he has a range of 100 yards, he
causes 6d6 damage to all in line of the bolt (victims can
save vs. spell for half damage), and he can travel from one
point to another instantaneously. If he tries to transform
and fails, he can’t try again for 1d4 rounds. In the rounds
when he can't transform, Galkin uses his short sword of
quickness to automatically attack first.

Before they can speak with him, the PCs must calm
Galkin down by helping him regain the concentration they
disturbed by entering the room. Focusing his attention on
one of the windows helps, as do soothing discussion and
kind words. Shattering the windows makes Galkin go
crazy, as the images he transferred to it come rushing back.
This makes him more angry, and he redoubles his efforts to
make the PCs leave.

If the PCs do calm Galkin down, he tells them what
little he knows about Nari. “She's not what she appears to
be,” Galkin explains. “She wants to take the House into the
Abyss — to use ifs secrets in the Blood War.”

DM Norte: If the PCs open any of the windows in this
room, they simply find themselves looking out of one of
the House's towers, high above Sigil's streets.

SLIPPING fHE Bunos: If any PCs were charmed by Nari
when she watched them in Bloodgem Park (at the start of
Chapter Il), those characters now feel friendly toward the
succubus and protective of her. While they won't yet at-
tack their companions, they may take action to prevent
Nari from being harmed — tripping a PC who rushes to
attack Nari, shoving a crossbow aside just as a PC
fires, and so on.

23. Minn Trap
The door to this room opens
into darkness. If the PCs provide a

light source, they see a large, featureless chamber. An
older woman lies face down on the floor right inside the
door, while a teenaged girl lies curled up asleep in the cen-
ter of the room. After all of the PCs have entered the room,
the door closes and disappears. They've entered the do-
main of Kaydi, a teenaged human female who's been in a
catatonic state almost constantly since her eighth birthday.
Her claim to the state of power-in-the-making is that her
Catatonia extends to the physical world around her, affect-
ing those within its area of influence,

The blankness of her own mind projects to the very
edges of the room. The furniture that actually fills the
room exists in another space, while the emptiness of Kay-
di's mind has become the reality here. The older woman is
Bereth, the House's custodian. Nari had Bereth placed here
to keep the custodian from disturbing her evil plans.

Just being near Kaydi puts all of the PCs into a re-
laxed, sleepy state. Every round within the area of Kaydi's
influence (a 15-foot radius), the PCs must make saves vs.
paralyzation to fight off stupor. On successful saves, char-
acters lose only one point of Constitution. Failed rolls indi-
cate more substantial losses; how many points are lost de-
pends on how close to Kaydi the PCs are. Within a five-
foot circle directly around the girl, a PC who fails a save
loses 148 points of Constitution. Five to 10 feet distant. the
PC loses 1d6 points. At the farthest range of her influence,
10 to 15 feet, the loss is only 1d4 points. When a PC's Con-
stitution score is reduced to 0, that character collapses into
a deep, sleeplike, catatonic state. Before the stupor claims
all of the PCs, those still awake must figure out how to de-
feat this mind trap. If they all fall asleep, they wake up
bound and gagged in Nari’s ritual chamber (Area 33),
where they're to be killed as part of her bid for powerhood
(the DM should turn to page 60 and proceed with the con-
clusion of the adventure).

Searching the boundaries of the room reveals no
openings, but the walls don't feel completely solid either.
It’s like touching flesh more than wood or stone. The walls
can't be cut or shattered, and magical attacks simply
bounce harmlessly away. If a PC tries to wake Bereth, he
probably fails — only a remove paralysis spell can awaken
her. Even then, it only brings her around for a few seconds,
but that might be long enough for her to give the PCs a so-
lution to this trap. She tells them they must wake Kaydi,
which they can do by simply shaking the girl.

If Kaydi is awakened, the blankness shimmers and
fades, revealing an ornate bedroom. Kaydi lies in a bed,

resting comfortably among plush pillows and thick

blankets. Any PCs who fell into a stupor also wake up.
Kaydi apologizes for any harm she may have caused and
tells the PCs to hurry and leave before she falls asleep again.
However, 2 rounds later, she goes back to steep, the blank-
ness returns, and any newly awakened PCs collapse again.

The group must escape while Kaydi's still awake, as
that's the only time when the door is visible. Three PCs
moving on their own or one PC carrying another can exit
each round through the door. Sleeping characters must
leave the area of Kaydi’s stupor effect before they can
awaken and begin to regain lost Constitution points
(which return at a rate of one point per round). If the PCs
decide to take Kaydi with them, the stupor field continues
to affect them.

If the PCs rescue Bereth, she won't be able to help
them. She explains that she has no special combat skills or
abilities; she’s only an administrator, However, she agrees
to find an exit and bring help back to the House. If the PCs
insist she remain with them, she becomes a target for every
attack they run across. If they let her leave, Sougad grabs
her to use in the ceremony he's planned for the final scene.

SuPPING THE Bunos: If the PCs decide that the solution
to this trap is to kill Kaydi, they have to deal with the con-
sequences of such an action. Of all the powers-to-be in
Harbinger House, Kaydi is the closest to making the ascen-
sion. If the PCs kill her, they release her life force to be-
come a power before it's fully ready. This results in a
weaker power, but a power nonetheless — and a power
very hurt and angry with the PCs.

Kaydi becomes a demipower of sleep with the follow-
ing spell-like abilities: deep sleep (functions as a normal
sleep spell but affects 4d4 Hit Dice of creatures) and dream
storm (inflicts 1d8+1 points of damage and target must
save vs. paralyzation or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds).
Before she departs both Harbinger House and Sigil, she uses
her dream storm ability to knock unconscious as many PCs
as possible. When the affected PCs awake, they're troubled
by unusual nightmares for the next 1d6 months — the
nightmares experienced by a power created before its time.
The bad dreams cause them to feel frightened and insecure
even when awake. (The DM may allow the PCs to later find
Kaydi and perform some service for her in order to end the
nightmares and case their troubled minds.)

33. Tue RITUAL CHAMBER

This cross-shaped chamber has been prepared for Nari’s
version of Sougad’s ritual. She believes it'll not only ele-
vate her to powerhood, but also push Harbinger House into
the Abyss.

A pair of double doors is set into each wall. One pair
provides the PCs with a way into the chamber; the locked
doors will later provide an entry point for Sougad. The
other two pairs of doors lead to Nari’s bedchamber (Area
32) and to a corridor that opens into the Abyss. When the
PCs enter this chamber, read:

Arcane symbols have been inscribed on the walls,
floor. and ceiling of this cross-shaped chamber. The sym-
hols glow with a faut, evil tight. In the center of the roam,
a large glabe floats about 10 feet above the floor. The globe,
almost 15 feet across appears 10 be made of deep-blue
stone. perfectly round and smooth, Thirteen sods, bound
and gagged, are fied to stakes in a circle around the globe.
Each sod has 0 different number of slashing wounds. and
all appear to be alive — barely.

The symbols are gill marks of chaos and evil, with
quite a few representations of the icon of the Abyss (the
infinity symbol pierced by @ downward arrow). The globe
is the focrux, a larger version of the planarity that Nari,
Sougad, and the Godsmen pelieve is the heart of the
House. It projects an aura that blocks the probing presence
of the Lady of Pain and her agents: as long as it remains
intact and operating, the Lady can’t sense what Nari is try-
ing to do.

The 13 sods are Nari’s contribution to the ritual; she
plans to kill them to become 4 power. While not all of the
sods are identifiably lawful, a few wear either lawful holy
symbols or the icon of the Godsmen. They also have parch-
ment notes pinned to their shirts and a set of the appropri-
ate spell components (either an iron rod and a bronze disc,
three nutshells, or @ crushed black pearl) tied to their belts.
What's more, they've all been prepared with a number of
shallow cuts SO that each can now be killed with a single

plade thrust. For example, the first sod,

who must be killed with a single

stroke, has been left unmarked.

The thirteenth sod,

however, has

already received
12 slashes.

THE FINAL BATTLE

After the PCs have looked around the chamber but before
they head to any of the other doors of try to free the cap-

tives, the doors leading to the Abyss swing open. Into the
room strides Crimjak, the marquis cambion, along with
three wretched manes per PC:

@ 60 

The doors to the left swing open and crash against the
wall. A whiff of noxious vapor emerges from the open
doorway, rolling around the tall figure striding forth. The
rowering humanoid stands 7 feet tall, with pitch-black
skin, pointed ears, and a wicked collection of spiked armor
and weapons. A number of short, pale, bloared beasts
crawl around tis Jeet, snarling and slashing the air with
their long claws.

“You berks are definitely in the wrong place af the
wrong time,” the tall creature growls bitterly, hefting his
ornate sword and moving roward you.

Crimjak wants to destroy the PCs or at least keep them
busy while Nari completes her ritual, and he’s brought
enough manes from the Abyss to grab the group's atten-
tion. As soon as the fiends and the PCs start fighting, the
commotion brings Nari, wearing her true form, out of her
chamber. She hurries toward the focruz, 8 long sword in
one hand and the planarity in the other. The planarity re-
acts to the larger globe and vice versa. Read:

As the succubus approaches the floating globe, #
storm of energy rises (0 the surface of the globe and begins
to dance within it. Spiky protrusions emerge from the sur-
face, jut as far as two feet from the globe, then plunge back
into the stormy depths. The smaller globe floating just
above the succubus Ss hand reacts in the same manner, mir-
roring the actions of the larger globe.

Nari begins to sing a chaotic chant, and all the
barmies throughout the House that she’s charmed or other-
wise convinced to join her begin to chant as well. The
chaotic clamor reverberates in the very walls.

“Slide,” the succubus sings. “slide into the Abyss and
leave this Cage behind!” You can feel the very walls vibrat-
ing with her song, @s though the entire House were singing
along with her. You tear your eyes away from the succubus
fora moment [0 fend off the attacking fiends. When you
look back, you see that she’s killed the first captive with a
single sword thrust and is lunging for the next one in line.

The PCs now have choices to make. Do they all fight
the cambion and the manes, OF do they split up to try to
save the bound sods before Nari finishes killing them? Give
the players 4 moment to make plans, but don’t let them
linger over complicated schemes for too long, Here's how
the NPCs act during the first three rounds of this battle:

® Crimjak and the manes attack the PCs, trying to

keep them too busy to interfere with Nari.

® Ineach round, Nari kills one pound sod.

# In the second round, Trolan rushes toward the
focrux, shouting, “Lady, we need you! Save us!”
He strikes the globe repeatedly with his sword,
trying to smash it. Nari. fearing the destruction of

the focrux, shapechanges into the Lady of Pain
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-17 -->
<!-- PAGE BREAK: page-18 -->

and, posing as the Lady, commands Trolan
to stop. “J ai liere,” she says. “Vou, in fhe name
of our love. Lcommand you to begone!” The dis-
guised succubus pushes Trolan away and, too
stunned to react, the tiefling simply falls back and
collapses to the floor.

+ In the third round, Sougad emerges from behind
the final set of doors. The surprise of his sudden
appearance causes Nari to lose her concentration
and resume her normal shape. Read:

The fur doors swing open with a crash, and
Svugod Lawshredder enters the chamber. “You

Sougad either has Bereth (if she was awakened and
allowed to wander after the encounter with Kaydi) or plans
on using one of the lawful sods staked around the focrur
as his thirteenth and final victim.

SLIMPING Bios: If Trolan's absent from the battle,
the DM should still have Nari polymorph into the Lady of
Pain (so the planarity can record her transformation for
later proof that the succubus tricked Trolan). One possible
solution: The energy in the shapechanging planarity
causes Nari to involuntarily change her own form;
each round, she takes on a new appearance,
one of which is the Lady of Pain.

THE GANG'S ALL HERE

The DM should finish up the third round and let everyone
make a new initiative roll. The NPCs each take the follow-
ing actions on their initiative numbers, depending on the
actions of the PCs:

Navi: If she acts before Sougad, she kills the next sod

to Crimjak for assistance.

Soucan: He attacks Nari to gain possession of the pla-
narity. If the PCs try to stop him, he takes time out to battle
them in the most expedient manner possible. He wants the
planarity in hand when he kills the last victim, and he has
no qualms about slaying Nari or the PCs to get it.

TRoLAN: Startled by Nari’s transformation to the Lady
of Pain and back again, Trolan stumbles about the cham-
ber, his faith in his one great love shaken. He won't help
fight any of the villains unless a persuasive PC convinces
him that his aid is needed (the PC must make a successful
Charisma check at a -6 penalty).

Cximax: The cambion is in a battle frenzy and won't
react to Sougad unless Nari calls him. He continues to
fight the PCs until called or Nari falls, at which time he
turns his attention to whoever threatened or hurt Nari.

‘Tur Manes: These witless tanar'ri simply attack the PCs
until slain. A few manes may also attack Trolan, keeping
him too busy to do anything but fight back.

POWER PLAY

If the PCs allow Sougad to strike Nari, the succubus takes a
serious wound. Sougad grabs the planarity
and moves toward the thirteenth victim
to finish his ritual. If the PCs don’t
stop him, he kills the captive sod
and quickly makes 12 more cuts
in the body. This causes strange
waves of energy to ripple from the
dead sod to the focrus,
from the focrur to the
planarity, and from the
planarity to Sougad. The
energy grants Sougad an-
other innate power —
chaos (as per the 5th-
level wizard spell, once per
day) — and increases the en-
chantment of his sword to
+3 (+5 vs. lawful opponents).
At this point, the PCs should
realize that letting Sougad finish his
ritual is a bad idea. The law slayer blade
glows with cascading planar energy. If the
barmy plunges the sword into himself, it'll open the
conduit of spiritual energy necessary to elevate him to
powerhood. However, Nari, no matter what else she may
be doing, screams with rage when she sees the sword start
to glow. “No!” she shouts. “! iust become the pawer, nat
you!” She grabs at the sword, struggling with Sougad to
possess it. Meanwhile, the planarity and the focrur con-
tinue to storm, sending explosions of color and strobing
light throughout the chamber.

RES®LU+F+ION

What happens next depends on what the PCs do — or don’t
do. The probable courses of action and their outcomes are
described below.

THE FOCRUX IS DEStROYED

Having seen Trolan attempt to destroy the focrur, the PCs
might try to do it themselves. However, the focrux can only
be destroyed by magical weapons. To strike it, a PC must
hit an Armor Class of 4. No damage rolls are necessary; in-
stead, the globe makes saving throws to see if it’s shattered
by the blow. The base saving throw is 4, modified by the
weapon's enchantment. For example, if a +2 weapon hits
the focrux, the saving throw is modified by 2, increasing
from 4 to 6. With each successful hit, the DM must roll the
focrux's saving throw number or higher for the globe to re-
main intact. A failed roll indicates that the focrur shatters.

If the globe is destroyed, Harbinger House is no longer
protected from scrying, and the Lady of Pain instantly be-
comes aware of the situation. Read:

The large globe shatters in an explosion of sharp

shards, bright colors, and cascading energy. A pillar of

light fountains up from the spot and crashes through the
roof, revealing the avercast sky of Sigil. A shadow moves
across the opening, its corners sharp and cutting. It’s the
shadow of the Lady of Pain.

Everyone in the chamber takes 4d 10 points of damage
from the explosion and the flying shards (save vs. breath
weapon for half damage). The slashing gaze of the Lady of
Pain kills Nari and Sougad — those who dared grasp at
powerhood — but never falls upon the PCs, Trolan, Crim-
jak, or the manes.

Once the deadly shadow passes, Crimjak’s too scared
to do anything but return to the safety of the Abyss. If the
PCs let him, he flees through the appropriate set of double
doors; if the PCs continue to attack, Crimjak fights with
manic fury until he can escape through the doors. The DM
can have the mindless manes either follow the cambion or
remain in the chamber to fight until slain.

SuprinG THE Buinos: If either Sougad or Trolan be-
comes a power before the focrurx is destroyed, the new
power is not killed. Instead, when the Lady arrives, she
casts the offending being out of Sigil, as powers are not al-
lowed to walk the streets of the Cage. Nothing can be done
to prevent this; in Sigil, the Lady's will is absolute.

THE SWORD SLAYS S®UGAD

The PCs can prevent Sougad from completing his ritual by
attacking the barmy or otherwise keeping him occupied.
However, if Sougad is left alone for even one round, he
plunges the glowing sword into himself, opening a spiritual
conduit. Sougad’s mortal body dies, and the focrur ex-

plodes, releasing planar energy into the chamber. This en-
ergy joins with the energy already collected in the sword,
turning Sougad into a lesser power of chaos and murder.

The rest of the scene plays out as in “The Focrux is
Destroyed,” above.

THE SW@RD SLAYS TROLAN

Trolan’s not going to wrest the glowing sword from any-
one's grip and plunge it into himself. However, PCs who re-
alize what's going on might choose to do so (or try to con-
vince Trolan that it’s necessary to prevent Sougad's ascen-
sion). In any case, if Trolan is killed with the law slayer, he
becomes a lesser power of peace and love. (The details of
the event are the same as in “The Sword Slays Sougad,”
above — his body dies, the focrur explodes, and the Lady
arrives to kill the cross-traders and cast the new power out.)

Before he leaves the Cage, Trolan uses his newfound
abilities to smother the negative emotions and end the
fighting; Crimjak and any surviving manes return peace-
fully to the Abyss. Trolan thanks the PCs for their aid and,
with a sorrowful expression, departs Sigil. He knows the
Lady won't tolerate his presence in her city, and he won't
push the issue. Instead, he'll go in search of a plane where
he can establish a realm and pine for the Lady in peace.

DM Note: Trolan’s last act before leaving Sigil is to
dissuade the cultists gathering in Bloodgem Park; see
“Stopping the Cultists” on page 64.

THE SW@RD SLAYS ANYONE ELSE

If Nari manages to get the glowing sword and use it on her-
self, all it does is kill her; she doesn't possess the required
spark of divinity common to the spell-touched barmies of
Harbinger House. The same thing happens if an ambitious
PC plunges the sword into himself (or Crimjak, one of the
bound sods, or even a manes), The energy stays locked
within the blade, waiting for a power-to-be to release it.
However, Sougad tries to get the sword back so he can use it
on himself; if he’s successful, events proceed as in “The
Sword Slays Sougad,” above.

THE SWORD SLAYS N® ONE

If the PCs defeat Sougad without destroying the focrux,
they still must deal with Nari (if she's still alive), Crimjak,
and the manes. Nari isn't really a major threat, especially
once her plans are revealed to be futile. She can’t become
a power or get the House to slide into the Abyss. She tries
to flee back to her home plane through the double doors,
fighting to the death if necessary.

Crimjak, on the other hand, can be extremely danger-
ous, and he fights wickedly at Nari’s side. However, if
Nari's dead, he has no reason to stay and fight; if she flees,
he likewise sees no point in sticking around. Without Nari,
the cambion tries to return to the Abyss through the
